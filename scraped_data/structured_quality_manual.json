        "content": "Contingency classification and progression regulations - The University of NottinghamContingency classification and progression regulations\nThis page contains the University's contingency regulations. Its content applies to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.The purpose of these contingency regulations is to mitigate against risk to student classification and progression where University business has been significantly disrupted. These regulations will be utilised when authorised by Senate.\nProgression - Undergraduate (UG)\n1.  Where Assessments and/or marking have taken place during a period when Assessments and/or marking have been disrupted (for example, global pandemic, industrial action, power outage during exam), University of Nottingham (UoN) will operate classification and progression regulations that differ from the normal regulations but deliver the same learning outcomes.\n2.  In order to apply the regulations described here:\na.  The Head of School (or nominee) must satisfy themselves that students meet (or will be able to meet if they progress) all of the programme level learning outcomes and meet with the approval of any relevant PSRB. If those conditions cannot be met by a student, then that student may not progress until the Actual Marks are received.\nb.  Students must Submit all their Assessments even if a disruption is expected (for example, during a marking boycott).  This includes re-assessments for a failure in compensatable module(s) where the complete marks transcript is not available to determine whether or not compensation can take place. This is in the student's best interest because if the module is not compensated then they might not proceed or progress to the next Stage.\n3.  A student’s choosing to not Submit an Assessment will result in the award of a mark of zero for that Assessment.\n4.  A student will be allowed to undertake a mixture of assessment and reassessment in the same exam period if they so wish (for example, to best enable them to progress without delay into the next Stage).\nApplication of the Contingency Regulations\n5.  Normally, UoN operates an approach to progression that uses a weighted average of Actual Marks from Completed Modules. When not all Assessment and/or marking is complete by the nominated Exam Board Cutoff date, UoN will instead make use of a mixture of Actual Marks from Completed Modules, Part For Whole Marks calculated from Incomplete Modules where possible, and Derived Marks based on past performance. All other parts of the progression model will remain the same (e.g. borderline regulations will not be changed).\n6.  Mark decisions are considered at student level, so within the same Assessment or module, it is possible that one student has an Actual Mark, another a Part for Whole Mark, and another has a Derived Mark.\n7.  UoN will proceed as follows, if by the Exam Board Cutoff date:\na.  All Assessments for a module have an Actual Mark (i.e. a Completed Module), UoN will use the Actual Marks for Assessments for that module.\nb.  A student has Actual marks for Assessments that are worth at least 40% of the module, then UoN will designate the weighted average of those marks as the Part For Whole Mark for that module. This includes Partially Marked Assessments (subject as always to Clause 2).\nc.  A student has Actual Marks for Assessments that are worth less than 40% of the module, or there are no Actual Marks for Assessments for that module (subject as always to Clause 2), then using Actual Marks provided prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date, UoN will provide the student with a Derived Mark for each Assessment that does not have an Actual Mark or Part For Whole Mark. The selection of marks to use and the formula used are explained in ‘UG: How to calculate a Derived Mark’.\n8. For avoidance of doubt, an Actual Mark  not received in time for the Derivation Cutoff (and so not used to calculate the Derived Mark) but then received prior to the Exam Board Cutoff, will be used as an Actual Mark at the Exam Board (even though that Actual Mark was not used to calculate the Derived Mark); in such circumstances the Derived Mark would not be recalculated.\n9. Part For Whole Marks and Derived Marks can appear on a transcript as module marks. For avoidance of doubt, it will not show on the transcript that these are Part For Whole Marks or Derived Marks. This information may be able to be provided in supplementary documentation where essential.\nStudents with Extenuating Circumstances\n10.  This section relates to students who have outstanding Assessments due to upheld Extenuating Circumstances (for example, where they have been granted a first sit for an exam).\n11.  In line with Clause 7, Actual Marks, Part for Whole Marks and Derived Marks may be utilized to determine the module marks.\n12.  In line with Clause 7, if by the Exam Board Cutoff date a student has Actual marks for Assessments that are worth at least 40% of the module, then UoN will designate the weighted average of those marks as the Part For Whole Mark for that module. This includes Partially Marked Assessments (subject as always to Clause 2).  At this point this could include the zero mark for the Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment.  However, the zero mark for the Extenuating Circumstances affected Assessment can be excluded in the part for whole calculation by the Exam Board if the non-Extenuating Circumstances affected Assessments with Actual Marks are worth at least 40% of the module.\n13.  In line with Clause 7, if there are Actual Marks for Assessments that are worth less than 40% of the module, or there are no Actual Marks for Assessments for that module (subject as always to Clause 2), then using Actual Marks provided prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date, UoN will provide the student with a Derived mark for each Assessment that does not have an Actual Mark or Part For Whole Mark. The Derived Mark can be applied to the student record for Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments after they have Submitted the outstanding Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment.\nHowever, it should be noted that if a student has outstanding Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments because of upheld Extenuating Circumstances at the Derivation Cutoff Date, the mark for those Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments will be recorded as a zero.  This zero will be used for the purpose of calculating the Derived Mark. This means that any resulting Derived Mark will be negatively impacted (lowered) and this is the Derived Mark that would be used for all Assessments without Actual Marks or Part For Whole Marks (whether or not an Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment).  It is not possible to recalculate a Derived Mark at a later date (such as after the Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment is Submitted).  Students in this position should take this information into consideration when making decisions whether or not to accept the application of the Contingency Regulations or whether to obtain Actual Marks (see below).\nProgression Decisions\n14.  If a student is unable to progress because of the application of the Contingency Regulations (for example due to a Part For Whole Mark or Derived Mark), Regulation 20 will be extended to allow students to proceed carrying a total of 40 credits of reassessments.\n15.  For students with outstanding Assessments because of upheld Extenuating Circumstances, which will be recorded as zeroes on their record pending Submitting the Assessment,  where the Part For Whole Mark (if it includes zeros from Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments) and/or Derived mark is not representative of normal performance, then the School may take this into account (for Zero Affected Modules) in making progression decisions under Regulations 10, 11 and 20. These considerations must be determined on a module basis, not elements of Assessment. This must be minuted at the Exam Board.\nDecision period\n16.  If any module mark is designated as a Part For Whole Mark or Derived Mark, then, subject to Clause 2, and provided the student satisfies the progression regulations given those marks, then the student may progress to the next Stage depending on their decision. All such students will automatically be offered a choice, supported with supplementary communications to explain in further detail, whether to accept or reject those marks and the progression decision generated by the application of these Contingency Regulations:\nThe student must choose either to:\na.  accept the progression decision and the associated marks. Note, any unmarked Submitted Assessments will not subsequently be marked and/or there will be no Equivalent Sit opportunities. This will be considered the default position (see below).\nOR\nb.  reject the progression decision and associated marks.  In this case the student will obtain Actual Marks as follows:\ni.  if there was an original Submitted Assessment and it is not yet marked, they must wait for that Assessment to be marked\nand/or\nii.  if there was no original Assessment, or the original Submitted Assessment will never be marked (for example, due to irreparable damage to or loss of a script), the student may be offered an Equivalent Sit opportunity(s).\nThe student will be required to make this decision when they receive a provisional progression decision. There will be a decision period of time for the student to consider their choice and seek advice. The deadline for the decision will be communicated to students in advance of the decision period so that they can prepare accordingly. If the student does not respond by the deadline, it will be assumed that the progression decision and associated marks are accepted.\n17.  If any module mark is designated as a Part For Whole Mark or Derived Mark, and if a student does not satisfy the progression regulations given those marks, then, subject to Clause 2, the progression decision and associated marks will automatically be rejected and the student will wait for Actual Marks or Equivalent Sit opportunity (see above).\n18.  If a student chooses to reject the progression decision and associated marks and to obtain Actual Marks, then:\na.  The decision would affect all the student’s marks.   It is not possible to retain Part For Whole Marks or Derived Marks on some modules and wait for Actual Marks/Equivalent Sit opportunities for other modules.\nb.  The Actual Mark the student receives for their original assessment / Equivalent Sit will be used in place of Part For Whole Marks and Derived Marks. This means that their marks could go down or up, which could impact the progression decision.\nc.  UoN are not able to guarantee when a student will receive their Actual Marks and resulting progression decision. This may mean they are not able to return at the start of the next academic year and it may be necessary for the student to interrupt for a year.\nd.  UoN will do everything reasonably possible to ensure Assessments are marked promptly.  Where this period is extended, then from time to time (for example, when some more Actual Marks are available) students may be offered another decision period in case they decide to change their mind.  In this case, any non-response would be assumed to mean the original decision had not changed (i.e. they continue to reject the application of the Contingency Regulations).\n15.  Where students are waiting for Actual Marks, Schools will prioritise these Assessments for marking.  This is a complex issue and will be decided at the time, as appropriate to the situation. It is expected that usually this prioritisation would start with Assessments for students who are due to graduate in the next graduation period.   Additionally, the timing of marking will be dependent on when markers with the relevant expertise are available for marking.\n16.  Where students are on an exchange from another UoN campus, then Part For Whole Marks and/or Derived Marks can be calculated using marks from the other campus(s) as appropriate.  Where students are on an exchange from another University, if there are insufficient marks on which to base calculations, then Schools need to submit an exceptional case to QSC.\nClassification - Undergraduate (UG)\n1.  Where Assessments and/or marking have taken place during a period when Assessments and/or marking have been disrupted (for example, global pandemic, industrial action, power outage during exam), University of Nottingham (UoN) will operate classification and progression regulations that differ from the normal regulations but deliver the same learning outcomes.\nIn order to apply the regulations described here:\na.  the Head of School (or nominee) must satisfy themselves that students meet all of the programme level learning outcomes and meet with the approval of any relevant PSRB. If those conditions cannot be met by a student, then that student may not be classified until the Actual Marks are received.\nb.  Students must Submit all their Assessments even if a disruption is expected (for example, during a marking boycott).  This includes reassessments for failure in compensatable module(s) where the complete marks transcript is not available to determine whether or not compensation can take place. This is in the student's best interest because if the module is not compensated then they may delay or prevent completion.\n2.  A student’s choosing to not Submit an Assessment will result in the award of a mark of zero for that Assessment.\n3.  A student will be allowed to undertake a mixture of assessment and reassessment in the same exam period if they so wish (for example, to best enable them to graduate without delay).\nApplication of the Contingency Regulations\n4.  Normally, UoN operates an approach to classification that uses a weighted average of Actual Marks from Completed Modules. When not all Assessment and/or marking is complete by the nominated Exam Board Cutoff date, UoN will instead make use of a mixture of Actual Marks from Completed Modules, Part for Whole Marks calculated from Incomplete  Modules where possible, and Derived Marks based on past performance. All other parts of the classification model will remain the same (e.g. borderline regulations will not be changed).\n5.  Mark decisions are considered at student level, so within the same Assessment or module, it is possible that one student has an Actual Mark, another a Part for Whole Mark, and another has a Derived Mark.\n6.  UoN will proceed as follows, if by the Exam Board Cutoff Date:\na.  All Assessments  for a module have an Actual Mark (i.e. a Completed Module) , UoN will use the Actual Marks for Assessments for that module.\nb.  A student has Actual Marks for Assessments that are worth at least 40% of the module, then UoN will designate the weighted average of those marks as the Part For Whole Mark for that module. This includes Partially Marked Assessments (subject as always to Clause 2).\nc.  A student has Actual Marks for Assessments that are worth less than 40% of the module, or there are no Actual Marks for Assessments for that module (subject as always to Clause 2), then using Actual Marks provided prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date, UoN will provide the student with a Derived mark for each Assessment that does not have an Actual Mark or Part For Whole Mark.   The selection of marks to use and the formula used are explained in ‘Undergraduate: How to calculate a Derived Mark’.\n7.  For avoidance of doubt, an Actual Mark not received in time for the Derivation Cutoff date (and so not used to calculate the Derived Mark) but then received prior to the Exam Board Cutoff, will be used as an Actual Mark at the Exam Board (even though that Actual Mark was not used to calculate the Derived Mark); in such circumstances the Derived Mark would not be recalculated.\n8.  Part For Whole Marks and Derived Marks can appear on a transcript as module marks. For avoidance of doubt, it will not show on the transcript that these are Part For Whole Marks or Derived Marks. This information may be able to be provided in supplementary documentation where essential.\nStudents with Extenuating Circumstances.\n9.  This section relates to students who have outstanding Assessments due to upheld Extenuating Circumstances (for example, where they have been granted a first sit for an exam).\n10.  In line with Clause 7, Actual Marks, Part for Whole Marks and Derived Marks may be utilized to determine the module marks.\n11.  In line with Clause 7, if by the Exam Board Cutoff Date a student has Actual Marks for Assessments that are worth at least 40% of the module, then UoN will designate the weighted average of those marks as the Part For Whole Mark for that module. This includes Partially Marked Assessments (subject as always to Clause 2).  At this point this could include the zero mark for the Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment.  However, the zero mark for the Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment can be excluded in the part for whole calculation by the Exam Board if the non-Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments with Actual Marks are worth at least 40% of the module.\n12.  In line with Clause 7, if there are Actual Marks for Assessments that are worth less than 40% of the module, or there are no Actual Marks for Assessments for that module (subject as always to Clause 2), then using Actual Marks provided prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date, UoN will provide the student with a Derived mark for each Assessment that does not have an Actual Mark or Part For Whole Mark. The Derived Mark can be applied to the student record for Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments after they have Submitted the outstanding Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment. However, it should be noted that if a student has outstanding Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments because of upheld Extenuating Circumstances at the Derivation Cutoff Date, the mark for those Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments will be recorded as a zero.  This zero will be used for the purpose of calculating the Derived Mark. This means that any resulting Derived Mark will be negatively impacted (lowered) and this is the Derived Mark that would be used for all Assessments without Actual Marks or Part For Whole Marks (whether or not an Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment).  It is not possible to recalculate a Derived Mark at a later date (such as after the Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment is Submitted).  Students in this position should take this information into consideration when making decisions whether or not to accept the application of the Contingency Regulations or whether to obtain Actual Marks (see below).\nDiscounting marks:\n13.  If the Part for Whole Mark or Derived Mark is lower than average for the Stage, the School may discount up to 20 credits (on a module basis, not by elements of Assessment) of these Part For Whole Marks or Derived Marks for the classification decision.  This must be minuted in the Exam Board.  This provision is separate from, and additional to, any application of Regulation 26b. For avoidance of doubt, where such a Part for Whole Mark may have been included in the Derived Mark calculations, the Derived Mark would not be recalculated.\n14.  For students with outstanding Assessments because of upheld Extenuating Circumstances, which will be recorded as zero’s on their record pending Submitting the Assessment, where the Part For Whole Mark (if it includes zeros from Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments) and/or Derived Mark is lower than average for the Stage, then the School may discount up to 40 credits of Zero Affected Modules  for the classification decision. These credits for discounting must be determined on a module basis, not elements of Assessment. This must be minuted at the Exam Board. This provision  would include any application of Regulation 26b (For example, a School could discount 20 credits under 26b plus 20 credits under this clause; or 0 credits under 26b plus up to 40 credits under this clause).\nDecision period\n15.  If any module mark is designated as a Part For Whole Mark or a Derived Mark, then, subject to Clause 2, the student will automatically be offered a choice, supported with supplementary communications to explain in further detail, whether to accept or reject a classification generated by the application of these Contingency Regulations.\nThe student must choose either to:\na.  accept the classification and the associated marks.  Note, any unmarked Submitted Assessments will not subsequently be marked and/or there will be no Equivalent Sit opportunities.  This will be considered the default position (see below).\nOR\nb.  reject the classification and the associated marks.  In this case the student will obtain Actual Marks as follows:\ni.  if there was an original Submitted Assessment and it is not yet marked, they must wait for that Assessment to be marked\nand/or\nii.  if there was no original Assessment, or the original Submitted Assessment will never be marked (for example, due to irreparable damage to or loss of a script), the student may be offered an Equivalent Sit opportunity(s)\nThe student will be required to make this decision when  they receive a provisional classification.

This means that their marks could go down or up, as could their classification.\nc.  UoN are not able to guarantee when a student will receive their Actual Marks and resulting classification. It is likely that their graduation will be delayed.\nUoN will do everything reasonably possible to ensure Assessments are marked promptly.  Where this period is extended, then from time to time (for example, when some more Actual Marks are available) students may be offered another Decision Period in case they decide to change their mind.  In this case, any non-response would be assumed to mean the original decision had not changed (i.e. they continue to reject the application of the Contingency Regulations).\n18.  Where students are waiting for Actual  Marks, Schools will prioritise these Assessments for marking.  This is a complex issue and will be decided at the time, as appropriate to the situation. It is expected that usually this prioritisation would start with Assessments for students who are due to graduate in the next graduation period.   Additionally, the timing of marking will be dependent on when markers with the relevant expertise are available for marking.\nProgression - Foundation and Qualifying Year\n1.  Where Assessments and/or marking have taken place during a time period during which Assessments and/or marking have been disrupted (for example, global pandemic, industrial action, power outage during exam) UoN will operate classification and progression regulations that differ from the normal regulations but deliver the same learning outcomes.\n2.  In order to apply the regulations described here:\na.  The Head of School (or nominee) must satisfy themselves that students meet (or will be able to meet if they progress) all of the programme level learning outcomes and meet with the approval of any relevant PSRB. If those conditions cannot be met by a student, then that student may not progress until the Actual Marks are received.\nb.  Students must Submit all their Assessments even if a disruption is expected (for example, during a marking boycott).  This includes re-assessments for failure in compensatable module(s) where the complete marks transcript is not available to determine whether or not compensation can take place. This is in the student's best interest because if the module is not compensated then they may delay or prevent progression or completion.\n3.  A student’s choosing to not Submit an Assessment will result in the award of a mark of zero for the Assessment.\n4.  A student will be allowed to undertake a mixture of assessment and reassessment in the same exam period if they wish to (for example, to best enable them to progress without delay).\nApplication of the Contingency Regulations\n5.  Normally, UoN operates an approach to progression that uses a weighted average of Actual Marks from Completed Modules. When not all Assessment and/or marking is complete by the nominated Exam Board Cutoff date, UoN will instead make use of a mixture of Actual Marks from Completed Modules, Part For Whole Marks calculated from Incomplete Modules where possible, and Derived Marks based on past performance. All other parts of the progression model will remain the same (e.g. borderline regulations will not be changed).\n6.  Mark decisions are considered at student level, so within the same Assessment or module, it is possible that one student has an Actual Mark, another a Part for Whole Mark, and another has a Derived Mark.\n7.  UoN will proceed as follows, if by the Exam Board Cutoff date:\na.  All Assessments for a module have an Actual Mark (i.e. a Completed Module), UoN will use the Actual Marks for Assessments for that module.\nb.  A student has Actual Marks for Assessments that are worth at least 40% of the module, then UoN will designate the weighted average of those marks as the Part For Whole Mark for that module. This includes Partially Marked Assessments (subject as always to Clause 2).\nc.  A student has Actual Marks  for Assessments that are worth less than 40% of the module, or no Actual Marks for Assessments for a module, then subject to Clause 2 and provided the student has completed at least 60 credits of modules in that Stage and has satisfactorily completed all of the required progression modules, then using Actual Marks provided prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date, UoN will provide the student with a Derived Mark for each Assessment that does not have an Actual Mark or a Part For Whole Mark. The selection of marks to use and the formula used are explained in 'Undergraduate: How to calculate a Derived Mark’.\nd.  If the student has not completed at least 60 credit of modules in that Stage or has not completed all of the required progression modules (as per the relevant programme specification), then UoN cannot offer a Derived mark as there is not a sufficient body of past performance from which to draw. In these cases, Schools are recommended to consider the following options (none, some or all of these options may be utilised as the School deems appropriate on a case by case basis, minuted at the Exam Board):\ni.  It may be possible for the student to proceed (see below).\nii.  If the student has extensive ECs and outstanding learning outcomes will be covered in the subsequent Stages, the School may exercise discretion to disregard up to 40 credits in order to allow them to progress.\niii.  Schools may assess students with Incomplete Modules through a viva voce to determine whether they demonstrate the necessary learning outcomes and can progress.  Students who do not demonstrate those learning outcomes, would be offered a re-assessment in line with the usual methodology.\niv.  UoN may be able to offer a later Derivation Cutoff Date for Foundation and Qualifying Year students after full year assessments are complete in order that the necessary thresholds for Derived Marks are achieved.  This would be determined depending on the precise circumstances of the application of the Contingency Regulations.\ne.  If none of these methodologies are appropriate, but the School wishes to make a recommendation to support the students’ progression then Schools may submit an urgent exceptional case to QSC to make a recommendation for how they are to be considered for progression.  Schools must agree this recommendation with their External Examiner. QSC will consider each request on its own merits.\nf.  If none of these routes can enable the student to progress, then the students will need to wait for Actual Marks (see below).\n8.  For avoidance of doubt, an Actual Mark not received in time for the Derivation Cutoff date (and so not used to calculate the Derived Mark but then received prior to the Exam Board Cutoff date, will be used as an Actual Mark at the Exam Board (even though that Actual Mark was not used to calculate the Derived Mark; in such circumstances the Derived Mark would not be recalculated.\n9.  Part For Whole marks and Derived Marks can appear on a transcript as module marks. For avoidance of doubt, it will not show on the transcript that these are Part For Whole Marks or Derived Marks. This information may be able to be provided in supplementary documentation where essential.\nStudents with Extenuating Circumstances\n10.  This section relates to students who have outstanding Assessments due to upheld Extenuating Circumstances (for example, where they have been granted a first sit for an exam).\n11.  In line with Clause 7, Actual Marks, Part for Whole Marks and Derived Marks may be utilized to determine the module marks.\n12.  In line with Clause 7, if by the Exam Board Cutoff Date a student has Actual Marks for Assessments that are worth at least 40% of the module, then UoN will designate the weighted average of those marks as the Part For Whole Mark for that module. This includes Partially Marked Assessments (subject as always to Clause 2).  At this point this could include the zero mark for the Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment.  However, the zero mark for the Extenuating Circumstances affected Assessment can be excluded in the part for whole calculation by the Exam Board if the non-Extenuating Circumstances affected Assessments with Actual Marks are worth at least 40% of the module.\n13.  In line with Clause 7, if there are Actual Marks for Assessments that are worth less than 40% of the module, or there are no Actual Marks for Assessments for that module (subject as always to Clause 2), then using Actual Marks provided prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date, UoN will provide the student with a Derived mark for each Assessment that does not have an Actual Mark or Part For Whole Mark.

These considerations must be determined on a module basis, not elements of Assessments.  This must be minuted at the Exam Board.\nDecision period\n16.  If any module mark is designated as a Part For Whole Mark or Derived Mark, then, subject to Clause 2, and provided the student satisfies the progression regulations given those marks, then the student may progress to the next Stage depending upon their decision.

It will be based on:\na. Actual Marks from Completed Modules received prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date will be included. It should be noted that marks visible in Moodle may not be Actual Marks, in which case these would not be used; the Head of School (or Nominee) would determine if it was appropriate to use those marks.\nb. Part For Whole Marks received prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date may be included.\nc. If circumstances permit, Actual Marks from Assessments from Incomplete Modules received prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date may be included.\n2.  The marks from Clause 1 (as circumstances permit), received prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date are the Completed Marks.\n3.  Because it is necessary for the student to have Submitted all of the original Assessments (where offered) to be able to calculate a Derived Mark, it is not possible for a student to have a Derived mark applied to their record where an assessment opportunity has taken place but the student did not Submit that Assessment.  Note, where the student has an upheld Extenuating Circumstance’s claim (for example, for a later first sit), they may have the Derived mark applied to their record after they have Submitted the Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment(s).  However, the timing of the Extenuating Circumstance Affected Assessment may impact the value of the Derived Mark (where the Extenuating Circumstance Affected Assessment was not Submitted and marked at the time of the derivation) and this should be taken into consideration in deciding whether to accept or reject the use of the Contingency Regulations and the associated progression or classification outcomes and associated marks (see  ‘UG classification’, ‘UG progression’ and ‘FYQY progression’ documents).\n4.  The credit value of the student’s Completed Marks in a Stage is the sum of the credits of the Completed Modules (whether entirely through Actual Marks or by way of designation of a Part For Whole Mark) plus the pro-rata credits of any Actual Marks for Assessments from Incomplete Modules where the circumstances permit their use for the Derived Mark (see Clause 1).\nFor example:\nA student on a 20 credit module who has Actual Marks prior to the relevant cutoff for 100% of the Assessment for that module has completed 20 credits of assessment.\nA student on a 20 credit module who has Actual Marks prior to the relevant cutoff for 50% of the Assessment for that module and where this meets the criteria to designate this a Part For Whole Mark has completed 20 credits of assessment.\nA student on a 20 credit module who has Actual Marks prior to the relevant cutoff for 30% of the Assessment for that module has completed 6 credits of assessment.\n5.  In order for the Derived Mark to be reliable, UoN need to make appropriate use of the evidence provided by these completed credits of assessment. UoN will calculate Derived Marks in accordance with the following thresholds:\na. If a student has Completed Marks for 60 credits or more from the current Stage, then the Completed Marks from the current Stage alone will be used to calculate the Derived mark.\nb. If a student has Completed Marks for less than 60 credits from the current Stage, then Actual Marks from the previous Stage will additionally be used to calculate the Derived mark.\n6.  The calculation of a Derived Mark requires the following information:\nN: the number of credits on a  programme per Stage (for example  120 credits per Stage)\nA: the credit-value of the student’s Completed Marks in this Stage\nB: the student’s credit-weighted mean for the Completed Marks in this Stage\nC: the student’s credit-weighted mean from module Actual Marks in the previous Stage\nλ: λ = min(2A, N)/N. This means that to calculate the value of λ, one takes the lower value of either 2 times A or N (so if A is 45 credits and N is 120 credits, one takes the lower of 90 and 120, which is 90) and divide that number by N (which is this example was 120, so 90/120, which is 0.75; thus  λ is 0.75).\n7.  The formula to calculate the Derived Mark is:\nDerived Mark = λB + (1-λ) C\n8.  The following information is given to further explain how derived marks are calculated from this formula.\n9.  For example, for programmes with 120 credits per Stage, to estimate the derived mark:\nUsing the table below, take the figure in Column D which is closest to the credit value of the student’s Completed Marks in the current Stage (value A above).\nFrom that row, note the values in columns E and F  (the weight for this Stage (E ) and the weight for the previous Stage (F)).\nMultiply the student’s credit-weighted mean for the Completed Marks for this Stage (value B above) by the value in column E (the weight for current Stage) to create a new value called G\nAlso multiply the student’s credit-weighted mean for the Completed Marks in the previous Stage (value C above) by the value in column F (the weight for previous Stage) to create a new value called H\nThe estimate of your Derived Mark is equal to G+H.\nHow to calculate a derived mark\nD.\nCredits of module at\ncurrent Stage completed\nE.\nWeight for this Stage\nF.\nWeight for previous Stage\n60 or more\n1.00\n0.00\n55\n0.92\n0.08\n50\n0.83\n0.17\n45\n0.75\n0.25\n40\n0.67\n0.33\n35\n0.58\n0.42\n30\n0.50\n0.50\n25\n0.42\n0.58\n20\n0.33\n0.67\n15\n0.25\n0.75\n10\n0.17\n0.83\n5\n0.08\n0.92\n0\n0.00\n1.00\n10.  The following is a narrative for the formula:\nIf prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date a student has at least 60 credits of Completed Marks in the current Stage, the formula will result in the Derived Mark being that student’s weighted average of those marks.  UoN take this to be appropriate because marks at this Stage are the best predictor we have of your performance at this Stage and at least 60 credits is considered a sufficient body of evidence for this.\nIf prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date a student has fewer than 60 credits of Completed Marks in the current Stage, the formula will return a result that is a weighted average of the current Stage in combination with a weighted average from work from the previous Stage. UoN need to do this because a fully robust sample of the student’s performance at the current Stage is not available.\nProgression and Classification - Postgraduate Taught (PGT)\n1.  Where Assessments and/or marking have taken place during a period when Assessments and/or marking have been disrupted (for example, global pandemic, industrial action, power outage during exam), University of Nottingham (UoN) will operate classification and progression regulations that differ from the normal regulations but deliver the same learning outcomes.\n2.  In order to apply the regulations described here:\na. The Head of School (or nominee) must satisfy themselves that students meet all of the programme level learning outcomes and meet with the approval of any relevant PSRB. If those conditions cannot be met by a student, then that student may not be classified until the Actual Marks are received.\nb. Students must Submit all their Assessments even if a disruption is expected (for example, during a marking boycott). This includes re-assessments for failure in compensatable module(s) where the complete marks transcript is not available to determine whether or not compensation can take place. This is in the student's best interest because if the module is not compensated then they may delay or prevent completion.\n3.  A student’s choosing to not Submit an Assessment will result in the award of a mark of zero for that Assessment.\n4.  A student will be allowed to undertake a mixture of assessment and reassessment in the same exam period if they so wish (for example, to best enable them to graduate without delay).\n5.  The 60-credit masters Dissertation/Project module must be treated separately and cannot be substituted by a Part For Whole Mark, Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark.  The Actual Marks for the Assessments for this module must be used alongside the outcome for the taught modules to determine the final classification for these students.  Heads of Schools are strongly encouraged to enable the marking of these assessments in time for the final Exam Board where possible.\nFor progression from the Taught Stage to the Dissertation Stage:\n6.  For PGT Taught Stage modules where the Dissertation Stage does not have a pre-requisite of any of the taught modules, the student can progress to Dissertation Stage.\n7.  Where pre-requisite(s) of one or more Taught Stage modules for progression onto the Dissertation Stage exist, Heads of School are asked to consider whether the student may progress or proceed to Dissertation Stage even if marks are not complete.  Schools may wish to consider the application of existing regulation (Regulation 24b) which allows students to proceed carrying 20 credits of resit marks in exceptional circumstances.\nApplication of the Contingency Regulations\n8.  For PGT students there will usually be an Exam Board for Taught Stage modules to decide about progression to Dissertation Stage and/or necessary taught module reassessment.  There will always be a final Exam Board where classification decisions are made.\n9.  Marks can only be derived (whether a Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark) for taught modules, not for project/dissertation module.\n10.  Part for Whole Marks can only be used for taught modules (not for the dissertation/project module).\n11.  Derived Marks/Provisional Derived marks (for taught modules) will only be calculated for one Exam Board. For example, if they are calculated for the Taught Stage Exam Board, they will not be recalculated for the final Exam Board.\n12.  If a Part for Whole Mark, Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark is used for a taught module for progression in a Taught Stage Exam Board, and the use of Contingency Regulations is accepted by the student, those marks will stand for the final Exam Board for classification purposes.  i.e. those Taught Stage Assessments will not subsequently be marked.\n13.  Normally, UoN operates an approach to progression and classification that uses a weighted average of Actual Marks from Completed Modules. When not all Assessment and/or marking is complete by the nominated Exam Board Cutoff Date, UoN will instead make use of a mixture of Actual Marks from Completed Modules, Part For Whole Marks calculated from Incomplete Modules where possible, and Derived Marks or Provisional Derived Marks based on current performance. It is not possible for PG Taught Stage to use past performance. All other parts of the classification model will remain the same (e.g. borderline regulations will not be changed).\n14.  Mark decisions are considered at student level, so within the same Taught Stage Assessment or module, it is possible that one student has an Actual Mark, another a Part for Whole Mark, and another has a Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark.\n15.  For Taught Stage, UoN will proceed as follows, if by the Exam Board Cutoff date:\na.  If all Assessments for a module have an Actual Mark (i.e. a Completed Module), UoN will use the Actual Marks for Assessments for that module.\nb.  A student has Actual Marks for Assessments that are worth at least 40% of that taught module, then UoN will designate the weighted average of those marks as the Part For Whole Mark for that taught module. This includes Partially Marked Assessments (subject as always to Clause 2).\nc.  A student has Actual Marks for Assessments that are worth less than 40% of the module, or there are no Actual Marks for Assessments for that module (subject as always to Clause 2), then using Actual Marks provided prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date, UoN will provide the student with either a Derived mark or a Provisional Derived mark, as appropriate,  for each Assessment in the Taught Stage that does not have an Actual Mark or Part For Whole Mark where it is possible to do so. The selection of marks to use and the formula used are explained in ‘Postgraduate Taught: How to calculate a derived mark and Provisional Derived Mark’. The Derived Mark and Provision Derived Mark will not apply to the Dissertation Stage.\nd.  Where it is not possible to use a Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark for a student (subject to Clause 2), then the student may not progress and/or be classified until the Actual Marks are received.  UoN cannot guarantee when that will be.  It is likely that the student’s graduation will be delayed\n16.  For Dissertation Stage, UoN will proceed as follows, if by the Exam Board Cutoff date:\na.  If all Assessments for the dissertation/project module have an Actual mark (i.e. a Completed Module),  UoN will use the Actual Marks for Assessments for that module.\nb.  If a student does not have Actual Marks for the Assessments for the dissertation/project module prior to the Exam Board Cutoff Date , then it is not possible to apply a Part for Whole Mark or to calculate a Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark.  In such cases, the student may not be classified until the Actual Marks are received, as follows:\ni.  if there was an original Assessment and it is not yet marked, they must wait for the original Assessment to be marked.  UoN cannot guarantee when that will be. It is likely that the student’s graduation will be delayed.\nand/or\nii.  if there was no original Assessment, or the original Assessment will never be marked (for example, due to irreparable damage to or loss of a script or recording), the student may be offered an Equivalent Sit opportunity(s). UoN cannot guarantee when that will be.  It is likely that the student’s graduation will be delayed.\n17.  For avoidance of doubt, an Actual Mark not received in time for the Derivation Cutoff date (and so not used to calculate the Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark) but then received prior to the relevant Exam Board Cutoff Date, will be used as an Actual Mark at the Exam Board (even though that Actual Mark was not used to calculate the Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark); in such circumstances the Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark would not be recalculated.\n18.  Part For Whole Marks, Derived Marks, and Provisional Derived Marks can appear on a transcript as module marks. For avoidance of doubt, it will not show on the transcript that these are Part For Whole Marks, Derived Marks, or Provisional Derived Marks.  This information may be able to be provided in supplementary documentation where essential.\nStudents with Extenuating Circumstances:\n19.  This section relates to students who have outstanding Assessments due to upheld Extenuating Circumstances (for example, where they have been granted a first sit for an exam).\n20.  In line with Clause 15, Actual Marks, Part for Whole Marks, Derived Marks and Provisional Derived Marks may be utilized to determine the module marks for the Taught Stage.\n21.  In line with Clause 15, if by the Exam Board Cutoff Date a student has Actual Marks for Assessments that are worth at least 40% of the taught module, then UoN will designate the weighted average of those marks as the Part For Whole Mark for that taught module. This includes Partially Marked Assessments (subject as always to Clause 2).  At this point this could include the zero mark for the Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment.  However, the zero mark for the Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment can be excluded in the part for whole calculation by the Exam Board if the non-Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments with Actual Marks are worth at least 40% of the taught module.\n22.  In line with Clause 15, if there are Actual Marks for Assessments that are worth less than 40% of the taught module, or there are no Actual Marks for Assessments for that taught module (subject as always to Clause 2), then using Actual Marks provided prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date, UoN will provide the student with a Derived mark or Provisional Derived Mark for each Assessment in the Taught Stage that does not have an Actual Mark or Part For Whole Mark. The Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark can be applied to the student record for Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments after they have Submitted the outstanding Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment.\nHowever, it should be noted that if a student has outstanding Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments because of upheld Extenuating Circumstances at the Derivation Cutoff Date, the mark for those Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments will be recorded as a zero.  This zero will be used for the purpose of calculating the Derived Mark and Provisional Derived Mark. This means that any resulting Derived Mark and Provisional Derived Mark will be negatively impacted (lowered) and this is the Derived Mark and Provisional Derived Mark that would be used for all Assessments without Actual Marks or Part For Whole Marks (whether or not an Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment).  It is not possible to recalculate a Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark at a later date (such as after the Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment is Submitted).  Students in this position should take this information into consideration when making decisions whether or not to accept the application of the Contingency Regulations or whether to obtain Actual Marks (see below).\nDiscounting Marks\n23.  If the Part for Whole Mark or Derived Mark (not the Provisional Derived Mark) is lower than the average for the Taught Stage, the School may discount up to 20 credits of these Part for Whole Marks or Derived Marks for the classification decision. This must be minuted at the Exam Board. This provision is separate from and additional to any application of regulation 24b. For avoidance of doubt, where such a Part for Whole Mark may have been included in the Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark calculations, the Derived Mark and Provisional Derived Mark would not be recalculated.\n24.  For students with outstanding Assessments because of upheld Extenuating Circumstances, which will be recorded as zero’s on their record pending Submitting the Assessment, where the Part For Whole Mark (if it includes zeros from Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments) and/or Derived Mark (not the Provisional Derived Mark) is lower than average for the Taught Stage, then the School may discount up to 40 credits of Zero Affected Modules for the classification decision.  This decision must be minuted at the Exam Board. This provision would include any application of regulation 24b.  (For example, a School could discount 20 credits under 24b plus 20 credits under this clause; or 0 credits under 24b plus up to 40 credits under this clause).\nDecision period\n25.  If any taught module mark is designated as a Part For Whole Mark, Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark, then, subject to Clause 2, and provided the student satisfies the progression regulations given those marks, then the student may progress to the Dissertation Stage depending on their decision. All such students will automatically be offered a choice, supported with supplementary communications to explain in further detail, whether to accept or reject those marks and the progression decision generated by the application of these Contingency Regulations:\nThe student must choose either to:\na.  accept the progression decision and the associated marks. Note, any unmarked Submitted Assessments will not subsequently be marked and/or there will be no Equivalent Sit opportunities. This will be considered the default position (see below).\nOR\nb.  reject the progression decision and associated marks.  In this case the student will obtain Actual Marks as follows:\ni.  if there was an original Submitted Assessment and it is not yet marked, they must wait for that Assessment to be marked\nand/or\nii.  if there was no original Assessment, or the original Submitted Assessment will never be marked (for example, due to irreparable damage to or loss of a script), the student may be offered an Equivalent Sit opportunity(s).\nThe student will be required to make this decision when they receive a provisional progression decision. There will be a decision period of time for the student to consider their choice and seek advice.  The deadline for the decision will be communicated to students in advance of the decision period so that they can prepare accordingly. If the student does not respond by the deadline, it will be assumed that the progression decision and associated marks are accepted.\n26.  If any taught module mark is designated as a Part For Whole Mark, Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark, and a student does not satisfy the progression regulations given those marks, then, subject to Clause 2, the progression decision and associated marks will automatically be rejected and the student will wait for Actual Marks or Equivalent sit opportunity (in line with Clause 25ii above).\n26.  If a student chooses to reject the progression decision and associated marks to obtain Actual Marks then:\na.  The decision would affect all the student’s marks.   It is not possible to retain Part For Whole Marks, Derived Marks or Provisional Derived Marks on some modules and wait for Actual Marks/Equivalent Sit opportunities for other modules.\nb.  The Actual Mark the student receives for their original Assessment / Equivalent Sit will be used in place of Part For Whole Marks, Derived Marks and Provisional Derived Marks. This means that their mark could go down or up, which could impact the progression and classification decision.\nc.  UoN are not able to guarantee when a student will receive their Actual Marks and resulting progression decision. This would also have a knock on effect for the classification decision.  In these circumstances, UoN is not able to guarantee when the student will receive their Actual Marks or progression / classification decisions.  It is likely that graduation will be delayed.\nd.  UoN will do everything reasonably possible to ensure Assessments are marked promptly.  Where this period is extended, then from time to time (for example, when some more Actual Marks are available) students maybe offered another decision window in case they decide to change their mind.  In this case, any non-response would be assumed to mean the original decision had not changed (i.e. they still continue to reject the application of the Contingency Regulations).\nClassification\n27.  If any taught module mark is designated as a Part For Whole Mark, Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark, then please see above.\n28.  Given the Dissertation Stage does not allow any use of Part for Whole Marks, Derived Marks or Provisional Derived Marks, only Actual Marks for dissertation/project modules will be presented to the Exam Board (albeit circumstances could be such that these marks are delayed, see above).  These project/dissertation module Actual Marks will be combined with the marks from the Taught Stage (see above).  Accordingly, there is no need for a further decision period as there is no further application of the Contingency Regulations.  The classification decision will be presented to students in the usual way.\n29.  Where students are waiting for Actual Marks, Schools will prioritise these Assessments for marking.  This is a complex issue and will be decided at the time, as appropriate to the situation. It is expected that usually this prioritisation would start with Assessments for students who are due to graduate in the next graduation period.   Additionally, the timing of marking will be dependent on when markers with the relevant expertise are available for marking.\nClassification - Postgraduate Certificate (PG Cert) / Postgraduate Diploma (PG Dip)\n1.  Where Assessments and/or marking have taken place during a period when Assessments and/or marking have been disrupted (for example, global pandemic, industrial action, power outage during exam), University of Nottingham (UoN) will operate classification regulations that differ from the normal regulations but deliver the same learning outcomes.\n2.  In order to apply the regulations described here:\na.  The Head of School (or nominee) must satisfy themselves that students meet all of the programme level learning outcomes and meet with the approval of any relevant Professional Statutory Regulatory Body (PSRB). If those conditions cannot be met by a student, then that student may not be classified until the Actual Marks are received.\nb.  Students must Submit all their Assessments even if a disruption is expected (for example, during a marking boycott). This includes re-assessments for failure in compensatable module(s) where the complete marks transcript is not available to determine whether or not compensation can take place. This is in the student's best interest because if the module is not compensated then they may delay or prevent completion.\n3.  A student’s choosing to not Submit an Assessment will result in the award of a mark of zero for that Assessment.\n4.  A student will be allowed to undertake a mixture of assessment and reassessment in the same exam period if they wish to (for example, to best enable them to graduate without delay).\n5.  Part For Whole Marks and Derived Marks can appear on a transcript as module marks.  For avoidance of doubt, it will not show on the transcript that these are Part For Whole Marks or Derived Marks. This information may be able to be provided in supplementary documentation where essential.\n6.  Where students are waiting for Actual Marks, Schools will prioritise these Assessments for marking.  This is a complex issue and will be decided at the time, as appropriate to the situation. It is expected that usually this prioirtisation would start with Assessments for students who are due to graduate in the next graduation period.   Additionally, the timing of marking will be dependent on when markers with the relevant expertise are available for marking.\nClassification process for PGCert\n7.  Normally, UoN operates an approach to classification that uses a weighted average of Actual Marks from Completed Modules. When not all Assessment and/or marking is likely to be complete by the nominated Exam Board Cutoff date, UoN will instead  make use of a mixture of Actual Marks from Completed Modules, and Part For Whole Marks calculated from Incomplete Modules where possible. Derived Marks based on past performance are not possible for PGCert. All other parts of the classification model will remain the same (eg. borderline regulations will not be changed).\n8.  Mark decisions are considered at student level, so within the same Assessment or module, it is possible that one student has an Actual Mark, and another a Part for Whole Mark.\nUoN will proceed as follows, if by the Exam Board Cutoff date:\na.  If all Assessments for a module have an Actual Mark (i.e. a Completed Module, UoN will use the Actual Marks for Assessments for that module.\nb.  A student has Actual Marks for Assessments that are worth at least 40% of the module, then UoN will designate the weighted average of those marks as the Part For Whole Mark for that taught  module. This includes Partially Marked Assessments (subject as always to Clause 2).\nc.  For PG Cert students, UoN cannot offer a Derived Mark as there is not a sufficient body of past Actual Marks from which to draw from as an indication of past performance. Accordingly, if by the Exam Board Cutoff Date the student has Actual Marks for Assessments that are worth less than 40% of the module, or no Actual Marks for Assessments for that module (subject to Clause 2), then the student may not be classified until the Actual Marks are received.  UoN cannot guarantee when that will be.  It is likely that the student’s graduation will be delayed.\nPGCert - Discounting Marks\n9.  Given the smaller evidence base, it is not possible to discount Part for Whole Marks outside of the usual Regulations.\nPGCert - Decision Period\n10.  If any module mark is designated as a Part For Whole Mark  then, subject to Clause 2, the student will automatically be offered a choice, supported with supplementary communications to explain in further detail, whether to accept or reject a classification generated by the application of these Contingency Regulations:\nThe student must choose either to:\na.  accept the classification and the associated marks.  Note, any unmarked Submitted Assessments will not subsequently be marked and/or there will be no Equivalent Sit opportunities.

This must be minuted at the Exam Board.  This provision is separate from, and additional to, any application of Regulation 24b. For avoidance of doubt, where such a Part for Whole Mark may have been included in the Derived Mark calculations, the Derived Mark would not be recalculated.\n17.  For students with outstanding Assessments because of upheld Extenuating Circumstances (also see below), which will be recorded as zero’s on their record pending Submitting the Assessment, where the Part For Whole Mark (if it includes zeros from Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments) and/or  the Derived mark is lower than average for the Stage, then the School may discount up to 40 credits of Zero Affected Modules for the classification decision. This decision must be minuted at the Exam Board. This provision would include any application of Regulation 24b and any application of the previous Clause.

This means that their mark could go down or up, as could their classification.\nc.  UoN are not able to guarantee when they will receive their Actual Marks or resulting classification. It is likely that their graduation will be delayed.\nd.  UoN will do everything reasonably possible to ensure Assessments are marked promptly.  Where this period is extended, then from time to time (for example, when some more Actual Marks are available) students may be offered another Decision Period in case they decide to change their mind.  In this case, any non-response would be assumed to mean the original decision had not changed (i.e. they continue to reject the application of the Contingency Regulations).\n20.  Where students are waiting for Actual Marks, Schools will prioritise these Assessments for marking.  This is a complex issue and will be decided at the time, as appropriate to the situation. It is expected that usually this prioritisation would start with Assessments for students who are due to graduate in the next graduation period.   Additionally, the timing of marking will be dependent on when markers with the relevant expertise are available for marking.\nStudents with Extenuating Circumstances\n21.  This section relates to PGCert and PGDip students who have outstanding Assessments due to upheld Extenuating Circumstances (for example, where they have been granted a first sit for an exam).\n22. As stipulated above, depending whether a PGCert of PGDip student, a combination of Actual Marks, Part for Whole Marks, Derived Marks and Provisional Derived Marks may be utilized to determine the module marks.\n23.  Both PGCert and PGDip students may have marks designated as Part For Whole Marks for some modules (see above).  These Part For Whole Marks may include the zero mark for the Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment.  However, the zero mark for the Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment can be excluded in the part for whole calculation by the Exam Board if the non-Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments with Actual Marks are worth at least 40% of the module.\n24.  In addition, PGDip students may have a Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark assigned to Assessments without Actual Marks or Part For Whole Marks (see above). The Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark can be applied to the student record for Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments after they have Submitted the outstanding Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment.\nHowever, it should be noted that if a student has outstanding Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments because of upheld Extenuating Circumstances at the Derivation Cutoff Date, the mark for those Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments will be recorded as a zero.  This zero will be used for the purpose of calculating the Derived Mark and Provisional Derived Mark. This means that any resulting Derived Mark and Provisional Derived Mark will be negatively impacted (lowered) and this is the Derived Mark and Provisional Derived Mark that would be used for all Assessments without Actual Marks or Part For Whole Marks (whether or not an Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment).  It is not possible to recalculate a Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark at a later date (such as after the Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment is Submitted).  Students in this position should take this information into consideration when making decisions whether or not to accept the application of the Contingency Regulations or whether to obtain Actual Marks (see above).\nPostgraduate Taught: How to Calculate a Derived Mark and Provisional Derived Mark\n1.  The Derived mark will be based on actual achievement from the Taught Stage, as far as reasonable. It will be based on:\na.  Actual Marks from Completed Modules received prior to the Derivation Cut Off Date.  It should be noted that marks visible in Moodle may not be Actual Marks, in which case these would not be used; the Head of School (or Nominee) would determine if it was appropriate to use those marks.\nb.  Part for Whole Marks received prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date may be included.\nc.  If circumstances permit, Actual Marks from Assessments from Incomplete Modules received prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date may be included.\n2. The marks from Clause 1(as circumstances permit), received prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date are the Completed Marks.\n3.  It is not possible to create a Part For Whole Mark or Derived Mark for the Dissertation Stage. Also, Actual Marks from the Dissertation Stage cannot be used to calculate a Taught Stage Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark.\n4.  It is not possible to calculate a Derived Mark for a student studying for a Postgraduate Certificate.\n5.  Because it is necessary for the student to have Submitted all of the original Assessments (where offered) to be able to calculate a Derived Mark, it is not possible for a student to have a Derived Mark applied to their record where an assessment opportunity has taken place but the student did not Submit that Assessment.  Note, where the student has an upheld Extenuating Circumstance’s claim (for example, for a later first sit), they may have the Derived mark applied to their record after they have Submitted the Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment(s).  However, the timing of the Extenuating Circumstance Affected Assessment may impact the value of the Derived Mark (where the Extenuating Circumstance Affected Assessment was not Submitted and marked at the time of the derivation) and this should be taken into consideration in deciding whether to accept or reject the use of the Contingency Regulations and the associated progression or classification outcomes and associated marks (see  ‘PGT progression and classification’ and ‘PGDipCert progression and classification’ documents).\n6.  The credit value of the student’s Completed Marks for the Taught Stage is the  sum of the credits of the Completed Modules (whether entirely through Actual Marks or by way of designation of a Part For Whole Mark) plus the pro-rata credits of any Actual Marks from Incomplete Modules  where the circumstances permit their use for the Derived Mark or Provisional Derived Mark (see Clause 1).\nFor example:\nA student on a 20 credit taught module who has Actual Marks prior to the relevant cutoff for 100% of the Assessment for that module has completed 20 credits of assessment.\nA student on a 20 credit taught module who has Actual Marks prior to the relevant cutoff for 50% of the Assessment for that module and where this meets the criteria to designate this a Part For Whole Mark has completed 20 credits of assessment.\nA student on a 20 credit taught module who has Actual Marks prior to the relevant cutoff for 30% of the Assessment for that module has completed 6 credits of assessment.\n7.  In order for the Derived Mark and Provisional Derived Mark to be reliable, UoN need to make appropriate use of the evidence provided by these completed credits of assessment. UoN will calculate Derived Marks and Provisional Derived Marks in accordance with the following thresholds:\na.  If a student has Completed Marks totalling at least 50% of the credits for the Taught Stage by the Derivation Cutoff Date (e.g. at least 60 credits for programmes with 120 credits of taught modules), then these Completed Marks will be used to calculate the Derived Mark for the Taught Stage.   In this case, the Derived Mark will be the weighted average of these Completed Marks which are received prior to Derivation Cutoff Date.\nb.  If a student has Completed Marks totalling between 16.6% and 50% of the credits for the Taught Stage  by the Derivation Cutoff Date (e.g. between 20 to 60 credits for programmes with 120 credits of taught modules), then UoN cannot be entirely confident that the student’s credit weighted average is a proper representation of their ability at this level. As such, for these cases UoN will calculate a Provisional Derived Mark for the Taught Stage.  This Provisional Derived Mark will be the weighted average of the Completed Marks which are received prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date.\nc.  Where a student has Completed Marks totalling less than 16.6% of the credits for their Taught Stage by the Derivation Cutoff date (e.g. less than 20 credits for programmes with 120 credits of taught modules), UoN cannot generate Derived Marks or Provisional Derived Marks for the Taught Stage. In these circumstances, the student may not be classified until the Actual Marks are received.  UoN cannot guarantee when that will be.\n8.  When considering classification and/or completion of Taught Stage, Exam Boards will have sight of the Actual Marks for the Assessments for the relevant Stage(s), and the Provisional Derived Mark for the Taught Stage. If the student’s Provisional Derived Mark for the Taught Stage is either of 2 degree classes (i.e. Pass, Merit, Distinction) or 15 marks higher or lower than the actual Taught Stage average (that is, the weighted mean of module marks for Taught Stage which will be a combination of Actual Marks, Part For Whole Marks, Derived Marks and Provisional Derived Marks), Exam Boards are asked to not use the Provisional Derived Mark  for the purposes of Taught Stage completion or classification.  In these circumstances, the student may not be classified until the Actual Marks are received.  UoN cannot guarantee when that will be.\nGlossary\nActual Mark:\nThe Actual Mark is the mark that comes from the Assessment submission actually (sic) having been marked, by a person with appropriate expertise. It is for Heads of School (or deputy) to decide whether sufficient marking and moderation has taken place for that mark to be used. An Actual Mark applies to each Assessment (so, to each element of module assessment).  For example, a module may have three assessments, a coursework for 20% of the credits, a presentation for 30% of the credits and an exam for 50% of the credits.  Each of these three elements would, in normal circumstances, have an Actual Mark.\nAssessments:\nThis includes all summative assessments (for example, exams, coursework, presentations, vivas) and all summative reassessments (whether as first sit or subsequent sits). It also includes all elements of assessment and reassessment within a module.   For example, a module may have three summative assessments (or reassessments): a coursework for 20% of the credits, a presentation for 30% of the credits, and an exam for 50% of the credits.  Each of these three elements is an Assessment.\nCompleted Marks:\nThese are marks as described in Clauses a, b and c (below) that are received by the relevant department prior to the Derived Mark Cutoff Date, and which may be used to generate a Derived Mark (or Provisionally Derived Mark). The Completed Marks will be based on the marks as listed below, some of which would always be included (Clause a) and some of which may be included in different circumstances (Clauses b and c):\na. Actual Marks from Completed Modules will be included. It should be noted that marks visible in Moodle may not be Actual Marks, in which case these would not be used; the Head of School (or Nominee) would determine if it was appropriate to use those marks.\nb. Part For Whole Marks may be included. This will depend on whether the associated Actual Marks have been received prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date and also whether a decision about whether these are designated as Part For Whole Marks has been made prior to the Derivation Cutoff Date.\nc. If circumstances permit, Actual Marks from Assessments from Incomplete Modules may be included. This will depend on a complex array of circumstances and is decided at University level.\nCompleted Module\n: These are modules where Actual Marks have been received by the relevant cutoff date for all elements of assessment.  For example, a module may have three elements of assessment: a coursework for 20% of the credits, a presentation for 30% of the credits and an exam for 50% of the credits.  Each of these three elements would, in normal circumstances, have an Actual Mark.  In these circumstances (i.e. Actual Marks for all elements) this would be considered a Completed Module.  The module mark would be calculated in the usual weighted average way.\nContingency Regulations:\nThese are the UoN’s regulations which are to mitigate against risk to student classification and progression where University business has been significantly disrupted. These regulations will be utilised when authorised by Senate.\nDecision Period:\nThis is the period of time given to student to consider the progression or classification decision (and associated marks) arrived at following the application of the Contingency Regulations.  It would usually be a few working days.  Ahead of and during this period students should consider their options and seek advice.  The deadline for the decision will also be notified to students ahead of the Decision Period where possible.\nDerived Mark:\nThe calculations used for Derived Marks are explained in ‘Undergraduate: How to Calculate a Derived Mark’ and ‘Postgraduate Taught: How to Calculate a Derived Mark and Provisional Derived Mark’ sections.\nDerived Mark Cutoff date:\nIf and when the contingency regulations are enacted by Senate in periods of disruption, the Pro Vice Chancellor for Education and Student Experience and Deputy Registrar will set relevant cut off dates.  It is possible that these are different for different student groups (e.g. UG, PGT, PGR) depending on the circumstances.  The Derived Mark Cutoff date will be the date by which all Actual Marks need to be received by (so by close of business on that date) in order for that mark to be included in the calculation of the derived mark for that module.\nDissertation Stage:\nThis relates to Postgraduate Taught students only. These students notionally have two Stages in their Programme of Study.  The Taught Stage relates to the taught (sic) modules that are not the final dissertation or research project.  For example, for a one-year full time masters totalling 180 credits, there would be 120 credits of taught modules; for a two-year full time programme there would be up to 180 credits of taught modules). This is followed by a Dissertation Stage (normally 60 credits).  In calculating a student’s Derived Mark, Taught Stage relates to the taught modules a student has  taken. For a Postgraduate Diploma, the 120 credits relate to the Taught Stage of the masters and there is not a Dissertation Stage.  In calculating a student’s Derived Mark, Taught Stage relates to the taught modules the student has taken.\nEquivalent Sit:\nIf all goes to plan a student undertakes one sit at an Assessment.  For various reasons sometimes additional sits are required.  For example, a student may fail a module and need a reassessment (or even a second reassessment if they are eligible).  Equally sometimes a student has an Extenuating Circumstance (for example, they are admitted to hospital on the day of an exam) and may be offered a first attempt at that assessment at a later date (a first sit).  An Equivalent Sit means that the student will get another equal attempt at that Assessment, whether it was the student’s first sit, a reassessment or a second reassessment.\nExam Board Cutoff Date\n: If and when the contingency regulations are enacted by Senate in periods of disruption, the PVC ESE and Deputy Registrar will set relevant cut off dates.  It is possible that these are different for different student groups (e.g. UG, PGT, PGR) depending on the circumstances.  The Exam Board Cutoff date will be the date by which all Actual Marks need to be received by (so by close of business on that date) in order for that mark to be included in the classification or progression decisions that the exam board will make.\nExtenuating Circumstances Affected Module:\nA module with one or more Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments.\nExtenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment:\nIf a student has an upheld extenuating circumstance claim for a particular assessment which is still outstanding (for example, first sit for an exam which has not been Submitted whether through self cert or otherwise) at the relevant date, then that assessment is considered Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment on that date. Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments will be recorded as zero in the records until the assessment is Submitted, then the zero would be replaced by an Actual Mark, Part For Whole Mark or Derived Mark as per the relevant circumstances.\nIncomplete Module:\nthese are modules where Actual Marks have not been received for all elements of assessment for that module.\nNon-Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessments:\nAny Assessment which is not an Extenuating Circumstances Affected Assessment.\nPart For Whole Mark:\nThis mark can be calculated when there are Actual Marks for Assessments, including Partially Marked Assessments, that are worth at least 40% of the module. The weighted average of those Actual Marks will be the Part For Whole Mark for that module.\nPartially Marked Assessments:\nfor Part for Whole purposes, a Partially Marked Assessment is when some questions within that assessment are marked and some are not, enabling a weighted average of the marks to generate an Actual Mark for that Assessment. For example, if an exam was weighted 100% for the module and it had 4 questions each worth 25 marks each, if due to the reasons for the application of the contingency regulations two questions were marked and two were not, then the Actual Mark would equate to 50% of the credits of the module and thus could be used as a Part for Whole Mark for that module.\nProvisional Derived Mark\n: the calculations used for Provisional Derived Marks are explained in ‘Postgraduate Taught: How to Calculate a Derived Mark and Provisional Derived Mark’ section.\nStage:\nA student’s Stage refers to the academic year of study: for instance, Qualifying Year, Part I, Part II, Part III.\nSubmitted:\nFor the contingency regulations to be applied for a student it is necessary that the student has attended, completed and/or submitted that assessment.  For simplicity, the contingency regulations refer to this as Submitted the Assessment (or Submit).  This applies to all forms of summative Assessment (for example, exams, coursework, presentations).\nTaught Stage:\nThis relates to Postgraduate Taught students only. These students notionally have two Stages in their Programme of Study.  The Taught Stage relates to the taught (sic) modules that are not the final dissertation or research project.  For example, for a one-year full time Master’s programme totalling 180 credits, there would be 120 credits of taught modules; for a two-year full time programme there would be up to 180 credits of taught modules). This is followed by a Dissertation Stage (normally 60 credits).  In calculating a student’s Derived Mark, Taught Stage relates to the taught modules the student has taken. For a Postgraduate Diploma, the 120 credits relate to the Taught Stage of the Master’s programme and there is not a Dissertation Stage.  In calculating a student’s Derived Mark, Taught Stage relates to the taught modules the student has taken.\nZero Affected Modules:\nThese are modules which include a Part For Whole Mark or Derived Mark (not Provisional Derived Mark) where those calculations included zeros from Extenuating Circumstance Affected Assessments. When discounting such modules the credits for discounting must be determined on a module basis, not by elements of Assessment.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n04 February 2025||"

For more information, please consult the following:\nImmigration sponsorship\n1.0 Purpose\nThe University monitors the engagement and attendance of its students for the purposes of wellbeing and improving academic outcomes, and, where required to, will report non-engagement and/or non-attendance to the appropriate bodies. This page outlines the regulations relating to this and links to the University Student Engagement and Attendance Policy and Code of Practice.\nStudent Engagement and Attendance Policy\nStudent Engagement and Attendance Code of Practice (Staff Only)\n2.0 Key Principles\n2.1\nStudents are responsible for organising their residential and other arrangements to facilitate engagement and attendance as required by their programme. Students must attend all teaching activities necessary for their studies, undertake all associated assessments and attend meetings and other activities as required by their school or the University.\n2.2\nThe Policy on Circumstances Affecting Students' Ability to Study and Complete Assessments details the processes that students and schools should follow when a student’s ability to study or take assessments is in any way affected, including if the student wishes the University to consider an Extenuating Circumstance. Where students wish to interrupt their study, they should follow the University's procedure on voluntary interruption of study. Retrospective interruption of study is not permitted. For more information, please consult the following:\nPolicy on circumstances affecting students ability to study and complete assessments\nVoluntary interruption of study\n2.3\nWhere a student is not engaging with or attending their studies, the School should follow the Student Engagement and Attendance Policy and Code of Practice. Where the School requires the student to suspend, and the student does not wish to voluntarily interrupt their study, then the recommendation to suspend should be forwarded by the School to Registry & Academic Affairs for consideration by the Quality and Standards Committee (QSC). If the School’s recommendation is ratified, the student will be required to suspend. Where it is identified that the student would benefit from additional support, the School should follow the Support to Study procedure.\n2.4\nSchools will use the Student Engagement Dashboard and the official University attendance capture system in order to follow this procedure, as outlined on the Student Engagement and Attendance policy. This policy is in place to support student wellbeing with engagement being a key indicator.\n2.5\nThe University has a Code of Practice for managing student engagement and attendance. For more information please consult the Student Engagement and Attendance webpage.\n2.6\nFor student visa holders, the University has a Code of Practice for UKVI academic engagement. For more information please consult the UKVI Code of Practice.\n2.7\nThe University has a policy regarding students required to withdraw temporarily or permanently on grounds of health and safety and it may be appropriate to manage non-engagement and/or non-attendance through that procedure rather than through these regulations. For more information, please consult the following:\nStudents required to withdraw on grounds of health and safety\nSupport to Study Policy\n2.8\nIf data in the Student Engagement Dashboard indicates that a student is not attending any modules, supervision or other required activities and the School has confirmed that the student is not engaging and the student provides no explanation for this non-attendance when invited to do so and does not engage with the process for contacting a disengaged student, the Assumed Withdrawal process will be followed. Further information about this can be found in the regulations governing registration in the Quality Manual and in the Engagement and Attendance Policy (link above).\nRegistration, attendance and study\n2.9\nWhere a student replies to the Assumed Withdrawal communication and provides an explanation for their absence, this will be considered by the School and any other relevant departments (such as the Visa and Immigration team and Student Account Services) who must determine whether the explanation provides good cause for the absence and whether and how a return to studies is viable, given missed learning. If the explanation offered does not establish good cause, the Assumed Withdrawal process will stand.\n2.10\nIf a student is identified in the Student Engagement Dashboard as having zero attendance and the School has no knowledge at all as to the student's whereabouts the School should contact Student and Campus Life and the emergency contact protocol will be applied.\nPostgraduate Research Students\n2.11\nAnnual leave for research students should be in accordance with the relevant guidance and where students do not comply with this they may be managed under this policy.\nResponsibilities of the student (PGR)\nApprenticeship Students\n2.12\nThis is applicable to all learners on a Degree Apprenticeship programme commencing study from August 2022.\n2.13\nEducation and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) funding rules require that active learning must take place at least every four weeks and evidence provided, in the case of block release programmes, active learning must take place every three months and evidence provided. Otherwise break in learning must be enacted to stop funding to the University. The Compliance and Engagement Team (Institute for Professional and Work-based learning) routinely measure evidence of active learning and will notify an apprentice where a non-compliance is found, giving five working days to respond and provide evidence.\nFor more information about ESFA funding rules, please consult the following:\nApprenticeship funding rules\n2.14\nIf evidence is not submitted within those five working days, Registry and Academic Affairs will apply a suspension from studies.\n2.15\nApprentices commencing study from August 2022 will have contractual obligations outlining this requirement, and any queries related to apprentice starts before this date should be directed to the Compliance and Engagement Team (Institute for Professional and Work-based learning).\n3.0 Related Regulations, policies and procedures\nImmigration sponsorship\nPolicy on circumstances affecting students' ability to study and complete assessments\nVoluntary interruption of study\nSupport to Study Policy\nStudent Engagement and Attendance Policy\nStudent Engagement and Attendance Code of Practice (Staff Only)\nUKVI Code of Practice\nStudents required to withdraw on grounds of health and safety\nResponsibilities of the student (PGR)\nRegistration, attendance and study\nEmergency contact protocol\nApprenticeship funding rules\n4.0 Version Control Table\nVersion Control Table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nRewritten to avoid duplication with Student Engagement and Attendance Policy and reformatted to align with new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework based on content last modified on 12 August 2024\nQSC\nOctober 2024\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n27 November 2024||"

        "content": "Extenuating circumstances regulation - The University of NottinghamExtenuating circumstances regulation\nThis page contains the University's extenuating circumstances regulation and provides links to the relevant procedures and associated guidance. Its content is applicable to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.1. Introduction/Overview\nThis section explains the University's extenuating circumstances regulation and provides links to the relevant procedures and associated guidance.\n2. Purpose\nDuring the course of a student’s degree programme, they might be faced with exceptional personal, medical or family problems and/or difficult and distressing events that are outside their control and that negatively affect their ability to take assessments and their academic performance. Such problems are known as 'extenuating circumstances'.\nExtenuating circumstances are situations or events that meet all of the following criteria:\nExceptional - different to what a student has to deal with in their usual day-to-day life.\nOutside of a student’s control – there was nothing that the student could do to stop it happening.\nNegative impact – it must have had a demonstrably significant, negative impact on the student’s ability to study or to undertake an assessment.\nThe timing of the circumstances must be relevant to the claimed impact; these are usually short-term in nature.\nThe extenuating circumstances regulation and associated procedures provides mechanisms by which students may bring extenuating circumstances to the attention of the University and allow for the consideration of the impact of those extenuating circumstances on their academic performance and the provision of measures to address the impact, where possible and appropriate.\n3. Scope\nIts content is applicable to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses. Where there are differences in regulation due to campus regulatory environment, these will be indicated. The regulation will be applied by the campus where the affected module is being taken.\n4. General Principles\nIf a student believes that their circumstances are affecting their ability to study, prepare or participate in assessments, then it is the student’s responsibility to let University staff know about those circumstances in a timely manner.\nThe University is committed to supporting its students and will seek to take account of extenuating circumstances where it is possible and appropriate to do so, and when they are informed in a timely manner.\nFor the purpose of extenuating circumstances, assessments are either an exam or coursework.  Ultimately the decision which type an assessment is for extenuating circumstances purposes is for the School/Department to decide and to inform students (usually via the module handbook). This coursework/exam distinction is important as it impacts the timeline for the extenuating circumstances claim and the possible outcomes.\nThe definition of an examination for extenuating circumstances purposes is a timetabled in-person written examination; an e-exam whether in-person or online; a language oral examination; individual presentations or vivas; and/or a practical skills-based (e.g. OSCE/OSPE) exam; group presentations or vivas would be considered exams. Note that group presentations or vivas and in-class assessments are not permitted for self-certification (i.e. evidence would always be required). A PGR progression review will be classified as an exam for extenuating circumstances purposes.\nCoursework includes any assessment where instructions are given in advance and students have days/weeks/months to prepare the submission.  PGR progression reports are included in this category. Coursework assignments are normally submitted through Moodle and/or through Turnitin.\n4.1 Guidance on acceptable and unacceptable circumstances\n4.1.1\nThe following gives guidance and examples of the types of circumstances and whether they might be considered as good cause for non-compliance with an assessment requirement or for missing teaching or required study. This is given without prejudice and for general guidance; it is not exhaustive, definitive or prescriptive.\n4.1.2\nIn general terms the extenuating circumstances regulation and procedures are intended to support students with circumstances that meet all the criteria in Clause 2 above. This should be used sparingly by students to address only those circumstances where there is significant impact.\n4.1.3\nNormally students would\nnot\nbe expected to submit multiple extenuating circumstances claims for the same assessment.  Where they do, the previous outcomes would be cumulatively taken into account in determining the new outcome, which may include rejecting the claim.\n4.1.4\nWhere a student has suffered from a series of discrete short-term illnesses resulting in multiple extenuating circumstances claims, a meeting should be arranged with the Personal Tutor and Support and  Wellbeing Officer (UNUK) or School Senior Tutor (UNNC) (or other appropriate staff member, e.g. PGR supervisors or SPSA) to consider the support options available, including the possibility of a voluntary interruption to study.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nVoluntary interruption of study\n4.1.5\nExtenuating circumstances would normally be limited to within one semester.  A pragmatic approach with due regard for proportionality should be taken in this regard.  Chronic conditions of the student would not be considered acceptable exceptional circumstances and the student should be advised to review the Policy on long-term conditions or disabilities affecting students' ability to study and complete assessments so that appropriate support for study or individual arrangements for examinations can be put in place. It may sometimes be necessary for a student to consider the possibility of voluntarily interrupting their studies until the circumstances have been resolved.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nPolicy on long-term conditions or disabilities affecting students' ability to study and complete assessments\nVoluntary interruption of study\n4.1.6\nThe University considers each claim of extenuating circumstances on its own merits, as an individual case and according to the relevant regulation and procedures.\n4.1.7\nThe following table of examples of the kind of acceptable and unacceptable circumstances are given without prejudice and for general guidance; it is not exhaustive, definitive or prescriptive: Due regard should be given to the reasonableness and proportionality of the outcome in determining what are and are not acceptable circumstances.\nAcceptable and unacceptable circumstances\nCircumstance\nAcceptable circumstances\nUnacceptable circumstances\nIllness\nThis is usually illness that spans more than 5 working days.  However, sometimes an acute illness would warrant an exceptional circumstance (for coursework and/or exams).\nThis includes students who have has a  late diagnosis of a disability or long-term medical condition.\nShort-term illness are not normally acceptable circumstances with regards coursework, where the student is given a number of weeks/months to complete and submit such work. However, the precise circumstances and timing of events will be relevant.\nAs general guidance an illness/ailment that does not require medical treatment or does not lead to a student being bedridden or will not cause a significant risk to others will not normally be acceptable circumstances.  Minor illnesses (e.g. colds) are not acceptable circumstances.\nHospitalisation\nThis circumstance is generally limited to extended or particularly seriously acute stays in hospital.\nA short visit to minor injuries unit or A&E would not normally be considered acceptable circumstances.\nA\ncute injury\nIf you have recently had an accident, injury or are experiencing a short-term health condition (for the first time), you may be in a position to request a short-term adjustment for your upcoming in-person exams (e.g. a scribe if you have broken your hand, or more time/rest breaks).\nFamily illness\nThe claim should make clear the nature of the relationship between the student and the affected relative and how the student’s ability to study has been impacted.  This would normally only include close relatives (i.e. parents, siblings) but, with that concept in mind, it should be recognised that family structures vary.\nThese would usually be a short-term condition.\nHowever, where the circumstances are external to the student and extend over more than one semester, such as chronic illness of a relative, it may be appropriate to accept the same circumstances for a longer period than one semester if it is not appropriate for the student to voluntarily interrupt their studies.  In such circumstances the student must discuss the situation with their School/Department and submit an extenuating circumstances form each semester to ensure that appropriate account is taken of the circumstances and appropriate support can be offered to the student.\nThis would not normally be extended to family pets.\nBereavement\nThe claim should make clear the nature of the relationship between the student and the deceased and how the student’s ability to study has been impacted. The circumstances of the bereavement may also be relevant.\nThis would not normally be extended to family pets.\nIT and/or computer failure during e\n-\nexaminations\nThis relates to the period of an e-exam only (not for coursework or exam revision).  This applies whether the exam is undertaken online remotely or on UoN facilities. Evidence will always be required.\nFor e-exams, loss or corruption of files is not an acceptable extenuating circumstance.  It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all work which is electronically stored, generated and/or submitted is sufficiently backed up, including backing up drafts of the work to the cloud or external sources.\nIT and/or computer failure more broadly\nn/a\nFor assessed coursework (or exam revision), loss or corruption of files is not an acceptable extenuating circumstance. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all work which is electronically stored, generated and/or submitted is sufficiently backed up, including backing up drafts of the work to the cloud or external sources.\nWithdrawal of IT facilities or suspension for reason of debt are not acceptable circumstances.\nAcute personal /e\nmotional circumstances\nThese may be considered acceptable circumstances, but students will need to demonstrate that they are seeking appropriate support including liaison with their personal tutor.\nAs with all extenuating circumstances, the University must be told about these circumstances in a timely manner (prior to the cut offs given in the extenuating circumstances procedure).\nPregnancy\nThe University has a\npolicy on pregnancy related issues\n. Students who are pregnant should follow the guidance in this document. In some cases it may be appropriate to use the extenuating circumstances procedure (for instance when a student suffers from a specific illness caused by the pregnancy), in which case the requirements for illness or hospitalisation above should be followed.\nM\naternity or paternity leave\nPlease see the guidance for supporting students with\npregnancy and parental caring responsibilitie\ns.\nPlease note, fathers are permitted to request extenuating circumstances for paternity leave.\nVictim of crime\nIt will be necessary to demonstrate how this has affected the student’s ability to study and/or undertake assessment, with reference to other requirements as necessary (e.g. acute personal/emotional circumstances/hospitalisation).\nDomestic disruption\nThis applies only in relation to examinations unless the circumstances are exceptionally severe and extended.\nDisturbances caused by housemates would generally be considered normal and therefore not acceptable as an extenuating circumstance. See also ‘accommodation disturbances’.\nAccommodation disturbances\nIt is the student’s responsibility to ensure that they have access to suitable accommodation, including for any assessments offered in the reassessment period and for the full calendar year for postgraduate students, and therefore ongoing or foreseeable problems with accommodation are not normally acceptable circumstances.\nRepresenting the University at a national event or involvement in some other significant/ prestigious event\nThis would apply to a wide variety of events, including but not limited to sporting events. Reference should also be made to the\nHigh Performing Athlete policy\n.\nJury service (UK)\nA student who is asked to undertake jury service that would affect their ability to meet any of the requirements of their programme should make a request to the Court for the Jury Service to be deferred.  Only where the Court has refused such a deferral will Jury Service be considered as an acceptable extenuating circumstance.\nDeferral of Jury Service is only permitted once by the Courts.\nCourt attendance (UK)\nThis would apply when a student had to make a court appearance (e.g. as a witness) or is accompanying someone attending court. This is different to jury service.\nTransport issues\nExceptional and unforeseeable transport issues only.\nIt is expected that students will ensure that they arrive at the assessment on time, irrespective of the form of transport used or relied upon. An inability to travel as a result of circumstances beyond the student's control may though constitute sufficient cause e.g. cancellation of a train/plane, car breakdown.  Students should, however, allow a reasonable contingency time in any travel arrangements made, including application for travel authorisation paperwork, as moderate delays are considered a normal expectation.\nHolidays\nn/a\nIt is the student's responsibility to ensure that they are available for all study activities and all assessments, including any assessments taking place on Saturdays in the main examination periods or offered in the reassessment period (August – September). All holidays and vacations should take place at a time that will not impact on the student's availability to study or undertake or prepare for an assessment(s).\nMisreading the examination timetable\nIt is the student's responsibility to ensure that they know and remember the location, time and duration of all formal assessments.\nScheduling of assessments/deadlines\nDeadlines being close together or examinations scheduled close together will not normally constitute acceptable circumstances.\nPaid employment or voluntary work\nWhere unforeseen or exceptional work commitments arise, these may be considered acceptable circumstances (this would normally only apply for part time students or apprentices).\nIt is expected that students will ensure that any paid employment or voluntary work does not interfere with their ability to engage with their studies or assessments. It should be noted that examinations may be scheduled to take place on Saturdays during the published examination periods. The University has\nguidance for students undertaking employment or other activities during their studies\n.\nExam stress\nThis may be considered an acceptable circumstance if a medical diagnosis of illness is made (see illness above).  Medical evidence would be required.\nPreparing for and taking assessments can be a demanding time both physically and psychologically and feeling ‘below par', stressed and anxious leading up to and during an assessment(s) is a common experience of many students and therefore not an extenuating circumstance. The typical symptoms associated with ‘exam stress’ (e.g. anxiety, sleeping disturbances, feeling nauseous etc.) would not normally be considered acceptable extenuating circumstances.\nReligious observance\nIf a student has completed\nthe Religious Observance Form\nby the published deadline and it has not been possible to make alternative arrangements centrally, the School/Department should take reasonable steps to provide an alternative assessment opportunity. Where this is not possible, the School/Department may consider a claim under this policy.\nStudents may submit extenuating circumstance claims in respect of performance in assessments affected by symptoms attributable to religious observance (e.g. Ramadan).\nAbsence from an assessment for reason of religious observance, where no Religious Observance Form has been completed, or where the relevant permission for absence has not been obtained prior to the assessment, will not be deemed an acceptable extenuating circumstance.\nReligious observance requirements will not normally be regarded as an extenuating circumstance with regard to assessed coursework where the student is given a number of weeks/months to complete and submit such work.\nCriminal conviction\nn/a\nIf a student is convicted of a criminal offence any disruption caused by the investigation or sentence is not an acceptable extenuating circumstance.\nForeseeable/preventable circumstances\nn/a\nWhere the circumstances are within the control of the student they would not normally constitute sufficient cause for failure to comply with the assessment requirements or engage fully with their studies.\nBeing reluctant to disclose the circumstances for any reason\nNot informing the University of circumstances for any reason are not considered to be credible and compelling explanations for non-submission of contemporaneous claims. The University can only consider circumstances if they are disclosed in accordance with this policy.\nSubmitting the same extenuating circumstances more than once\nThis would only be considered acceptable if the student has accessed appropriate support to manage the circumstances but there is an unexpected acute episode at a particularly significant time.\nSubmitting the same extenuating circumstances more than once would not normally be considered an acceptable circumstance.\nL\nong term conditions\nn/a\nIt is not normally possible for the circumstance to have arisen more than 12 months before the affected assessment for a claim to be made under this regulation.\nMatters which extend over 12 months would need to claim under the\nPolicy on long-term conditions or disabilities affecting students' ability to study and complete assessments\nso that appropriate support for study or individual arrangements for examinations can be put in place.\n4.2 Requirement for evidence\nExtenuating circumstance claims with evidence have a broader range of outcomes available to them than those without evidence.\nAlso, some assessments are not allowed to have extenuating circumstances claims without evidence.  Schools/Departments will notify students (e.g. via the module handbook) which assessments these are.\nStudents studying on the UNM or UNNC campuses (whether full time or as an exchange student) are not permitted to have extenuating circumstances without evidence, whether exam or coursework, due to local regulations.\n4.2.1   Self-certification from an exam (no evidence required)\nNot applicable to circumstances relating to modules being undertaken at the UNM or UNNC campuses.\nWhere a student is prevented from attending an individual summative examination due to circumstances which meet all of the criteria set out in the Extenuating Circumstances Regulation (Clause 2), they may use self-certification if they are unable to provide any other form of evidence.\nFor clarity, this policy is intended for use by students who, unexpectedly, are unable to attend an examination due to short-term, acute circumstances e.g. a migraine or sickness and diarrhoea, and who are unable to obtain medical evidence of this. If a student wishes to give advance notice of their inability to sit an examination, evidence will be required for this as part of their EC claim.\nSelf-certification is only available for individual, summative, in person examinations; it will not be accepted for:\nabsence from a group assessment.\nabsence from a practice placement.\nan examination that the student attended (self-certification is only applicable to non-attendance of assessments).\nStudents may self-certificate absence from an examination(s) for a maximum of 2 consecutive calendar days in an examination period, using the extenuating circumstances (EC) claim form. For absence of more than two consecutive calendar days, or for a further EC claim in the same examination period, medical or other evidence is required.\nThe only potential outcome available in the event of a self-certificated absence claim is a further attempt at the assessment. That is, student who are absent from an examination and who self-certify will be required to undertake the examination at the next scheduled time the examination is run, normally in the August/September ‘re-sit’ period. The student will be offered a further attempt on the same basis as the missed assessment i.e. if a first sit attempt assessment was missed, a further first attempt will be offered, if a reassessment was missed, a further reassessment attempt will be offered.  Bespoke examinations to facilitate progression, graduation etc. will not be scheduled i.e. there will be no opportunity to take reassessments outside the next scheduled period.\nNormally, the further attempt will be in the format of an examination, however, a different form of re-assessment to assess whether the learning outcomes are achieved, as determined by the School/Department, may be recommended if the same or equivalent of the original is no longer possible.\nSelf-certified assessments are not eligible for discounting by Examination Boards for the purposes of calculating either module marks or degree classifications.\nStudents should be aware that if they self-certify their absence from a reassessment examination, they may be prevented from progressing to the next stage of study, if the progression requirements of the course have not been met. Subject to the progression requirements of the course, some students may be able to proceed to the next stage of study, carrying the outstanding assessment but, if not, they will have to interrupt their studies until the next scheduled assessment opportunity. Registry and Academic Affairs will notify students of the impact of their non-attendance on progression after the meeting of the relevant progression or classification Examination Board.\n4.2.2 Self-certifying for other assessment types:\nSchools may allow students to self-certify for other individual, summative assessments that are either e-exams or exams for extenuating circumstances purposes (see §xxxxx) for a maximum of 2 consecutive calendar days. Only assessments where a first sit opportunity exists may be eligible. Assessments where self-certification is permitted should be clearly indicated via Moodle/Course handbook. A School must robustly monitor attendance such that self-certification is only allowed for non-attendance at assessments. A student may not self-certify for an e-exam that they have viewed.\nWhen self-certifying absence, all students should read and understand the implications of the University’s Maximum period from initial registration which sets out that stages of study must be completed within a prescribed timeframe.  For more information about the Maximum period from initial registration, please consult the following:\nMaximum period from initial registration for completion of studies\nThe University reserves the right to review the use of self-certification by students and to require evidence for multiple and frequent use of self-certification, for example, more than twice in an academic session (year).\nThe University holds a reasonable expectation that students will only self-certify their absence from assessments when prevented from attending by circumstances that align with acceptable exceptional circumstances.\nClaims which are believed to give fraudulent reasons for absence from the assessment will be investigated under the Academic Misconduct regulation.\n4.2.3   Coursework extension without evidence\nNot applicable to circumstances relating to modules being undertaken at the UNM or UNNC campuses.\nWhere a student experiences circumstances which meet all of the criteria set out in the extenuating circumstances regulation (Clause 2) but where evidence is not available, and if the School/Department permits for that assessment, an extenuating circumstance claim may be made without evidence to extend a coursework deadline. Schools/Departments need to inform students if `no evidence’ extensions are not permitted (for example via module handbooks). It is possible for some assessments in a School/Department to be eligible for `no evidence’ extensions and not others.\nUnlike a ‘grace period’ there must be an associated circumstance and short term no evidence extension requests may be declined if the circumstances are not considered acceptable. (further explanation of acceptable and unacceptable circumstances can be found in section 4.1.7 above.\nThe only outcome available in these circumstances is an extension of up to five working days.The extension request should align with the time impacted (e.g. if impacted for 2 working days, then the extension request should not be for more than 2 working days).\nIf a student requires a different outcome, for example a longer extension, then evidence will be required for this as part of their extenuating circumstance claim.\nIt is not possible to request a short term no evidence extension to add extra time onto an already upheld evidenced extension. If a second circumstance has occurred following an evidenced extension, then a further extenuating circumstance request can be made and it would require evidence (noting the circumstances around lengths of extensions in coursework outcomes 2 and 3).\nIt is possible to request an evidenced extension after a short term no evidence extension, for example if the reason turned out to be taking longer to resolve than originally expected or if a second circumstance had occurred. If the request was upheld, the duration of the short term no evidence extension already granted, would be taken into account (for example, if outcome 2 were decided on then the no evidence extension duration plus the evidenced extension duration would not be more than 15 working days).\nCoursework assessments with ‘no evidence’ extensions are not eligible for discounting by examination boards for the purposes of calculating either module marks or degree classifications.\nThe University reserves the right to review the use of ‘no evidence’ extensions by students and to require evidence for multiple and frequent use of ‘no evidence’ extensions, for example, more than twice in an academic session (year).\nThe University holds a reasonable expectation that students will only use ‘no evidence’ extensions for coursework assessments when prevented from attending by circumstances that align with acceptable exceptional circumstances  (see section 4.1.7 above for more guidance).\nClaims which are believed to give fraudulent reasons will be investigated under the Academic Misconduct regulation and procedure.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nAcademic misconduct regulations\n4.3 Standard of evidence\n4.3.1\nIndependent, reliable documentary evidence is normally required to accompany an extenuating circumstance claim. The exceptions are:\nWhen the student is making a  self-certification claim for an examination,\nFor coursework extensions of up to five working days, unless the School/Department has explicitly told students (e.g. in the module handbook) that that is not permitted for a given assessment.\n4.3.2\nThe burden of proof to support a claim lies with the student at all times.\n4.3.3\nEvidence presented by students must meet the following standards and should:\n(a) Where written by appropriately qualified professionals who are independent of the student, be on headed paper and signed and dated by the author. Evidence presented by email may be acceptable if the email has been sent by the author from the official domain name of the author's organisation.  Students should note that the Cripps Health Centre and the University Counselling Service in the UK or UNNC Health and Wellbeing Centre will be unlikely to provide such confirmation if the student has had no engagement with the service(s) prior to the affected assessment(s).\n(b) Confirm specifically that the circumstances were witnessed on the relevant date as opposed to being reported retrospectively. Evidence reported by the author as being informed retrospectively about the circumstances will not be acceptable evidence.\n(c) Be in English. It is the student's responsibility to provide supporting documentation and any translation should be undertaken by an accredited translator (e.g. be a member of the Association of Translation Companies (UNUK), or an accredited translator from a qualified translation institution (UNNC). Any associated costs must be met by the student.\n(d) Be unaltered by the student.  Documentation that has been amended for any reason will be deemed inadmissible by the University and may be subject to investigation under the Academic Misconduct Procedure (UNUK, UNM, UNNC).\n4.3.4\nSchools/Departments could also consider evidence supplied by other members of staff known to the student, for example, Personal Tutors, Support and Wellbeing Officers or Hall Wardens.  It is not possible for University staff to give evidence for medical conditions.\nPeople in these roles should only provide supporting evidence if:\nThe student has engaged with them sufficiently prior to the affected assessment(s) such that they are fully conversant with their situation.  Retrospective information is not permitted as evidence.\nThey are satisfied that there will have been an adverse impact on the student’s ability to study and/or take assessments.\nThe student does not require medical/professional treatment for their circumstances.\n4.3.5\nThe University reserves the right to take such steps as are deemed necessary to verify the evidence submitted, without prior notification.  Where the University is unable to authenticate the material to its satisfaction, the claim may not be accepted. The University reserves the right to request sight of original documents, if necessary.  If there is evidence that a student has fraudulently presented documentation to the University the matter will usually be referred for consideration under the University’s Academic Misconduct regulations (UNUK, UNM, UNNC).\n4.3.6\nThe following table offers examples of the associated evidence that is normally required to accompany acceptable circumstances (noting the exceptions in clause 4.3.1). These are given without prejudice and for general guidance; it is not exhaustive, definitive, or prescriptive. Due regard should be given to the reasonableness and proportionality of the outcome in determining what is and is not acceptable evidence.\nAcceptable circumstances - Associated evidence\nCircumstance\nEvidence\nIllness\nPrintouts from the NHS app which attest to the circumstances claimed in the form.\nWhere possible, a letter from an appropriate medical professional or statement from the University Counselling Service (or equivalent) confirming the nature of the illness and the likely impact it is having on the student's ability to undertake formal assessment and/or study. This includes medical certificates supplied by online doctors, provided that they are UK based and CQC-regulated.\nChina specific requirements:\nA letter of medical diagnosis issued by appropriate medical professional at AA or AA+ hospital in China (or equivalent) or statement from the\nUNNC Health and Wellbeing Centre\nconfirming the nature of the illness and the likely impact it is having on the student’s ability to undertake formal assessment and/or study. The diagnosis letter should be issued in letterhead and stamped by the hospital as deemed official.  Medical certificates supplied by online doctors are not acceptable.\nHospitalisation/\nacute injury\nDischarge notes.\nA medical letter/certificate from the relevant hospital confirming the nature of the student's circumstances.\nLetter of appointment for a specialist consultation, investigation or outpatient treatment.\nStudents should not need to visit a Health Centre to provide medical certification when they have an obvious physical injury. Corroboration, such as a note from a hospital casualty department, or from a tutor who has seen the injury, would normally be sufficient. Examples of obvious physical injury could include plaster casts or metal pins supporting broken bones.\nChina specific requirements:\nA discharge report issued by appropriate medical professional at AA or AA+ hospital in China (or equivalent) confirming the nature of the student’s circumstances , the period of hospitalisation and likely impact it may have on the student’s ability to undertake formal assessment and/or study. The discharge report issued in letterhead and stamped by the hospital as deemed official.\nFamily illness\nA medical certificate/letter from a medical professional confirming the nature and severity of the family circumstances.\nAforementioned China specific requirements would apply.\nBereavement\nA death certificate\nor\na letter confirming the death from an independent person (usually not a family member) Evidence from a hospital Family Bereavement Centre, or equivalent.\nWhere these are not available, an order of service from the funeral.\nIt is recognised that these levels of evidence are not always possible.  Schools are permitted to use their discretion (e.g. tutor statement).\nIT and/or computer failure during e\n-\nexaminations\nScreen shots of the issue which demonstrate the timing and the longevity of the issue.\nWhere relevant, a statement of disrupted service from an internet provider.\nAcute personal/\nemotional circumstances\nAn original medical certificate or letter from an appropriate medical professional or a letter from the University Counselling Service (or equivalent) confirming a list of counselling session attended dates.\nAforementioned China specific requirements would apply.\nIf extenuating circumstance panels require further information, please contact the counselling service directly. It is unlikely that evidence will be given if there has been limited or no recent engagement with the service.\nPregnancy\nMedical documentation and/or supporting letter from personal tutor, depending on the circumstances.\nVictim of crime\nA written statement of events which is supported by written evidence from the Police (including a crime reference number).\nWhere the impact of the crime has led to a medical or other professional consultation, an original medical certificate or letter from an appropriate medical professional or a letter from the University Counselling Service (or equivalent) confirming the likely impact the reported crime had/is having on the student's ability to undertake formal assessment and/or study.\nFor extreme circumstances (e.g. domestic or sexual abuse) it may be that a supporting letter from the personal tutor is appropriate evidence.\nDomestic disruption\nWhere significant and unforeseen domestic disruption has occurred very close to a timetabled examination a letter from an appropriate independent individual/authority detailing the relevant circumstances and an indication of the likely impact with their contact details provided.\nRepresenting the University at a national event or involvement in some other significant/ prestigious event\nA letter of confirmation from the relevant organising body (or from their website) and a supporting statement from the student explaining why the event should be considered as significant/prestigious and the reason(s) why they are required to be absent from University.\nFor applications under the High Performing Athlete policy, a letter from the coach or personal tutor may be appropriate evidence.\nJury service (UK)\nA letter from the Court together with proof that a deferral has been requested and rejected or proof that a previous request for deferral has been accepted.\nCourt attendance (UK)\nWhere a student is required to attend a tribunal or court as a witness, defendant (see ‘Criminal Conviction’, Unacceptable Circumstances) or plaintiff the student should provide official correspondence from the tribunal/court confirming attendance or a solicitor’s letter detailing the nature and dates of the legal proceedings and the requirement for the student to attend.\n4.4 Outcome Recommendations for EC Panels\n4.4.1   Core considerations\nThe full range of recommendations open to a Panel are detailed below.\nAn extenuating circumstances panel cannot change marks; marks or classifications can only be altered by reassessment or the setting aside of a module or element of a module when computing a mark or classification.\nPanels should always first consider allowing a student an additional attempt as opposed to disregarding of elements or modules, making this latter recommendation only when additional attempts are not possible or are undesirable.\nIf a student’s Extenuating Circumstance claim for an exam is upheld, the extenuating circumstance outcome awarded will not be optional.  That is, if the student is granted another attempt at that assessment, the student will need to take that assessment as the original (affected) assessment will not be marked or the mark not released to the student.\nIf the student does not undertake the additional attempt granted by the extenuating circumsntances request, they would be given zero for non-attendance at the exam.  Students will need to decide before submitting the extenuating circumstance claim whether they have been impacted.  It will not normally be possible to decide on an outcome after assessment marks are released, and such circumstances would require an exceptional case to QSC for approval.\nIf a student has made multiple extenuating circumstances claims, or perhaps extended study for other reasons (e.g. Voluntary Interruption of Study), a further extension or attempt at an examination may take the student over the maximum period for stage or registration.  In such circumstances the extenuating circumstances panel must submit an Exceptional Case to the Quality and Standards Committee to seek an extension to the stage or registration (as appropriate) prior to sending a decision to the student for the extenuating circumstances claim.  The panel will need to consider currency of learning, previous extensions and impact on the student in making the case.  If this is approved, then a decision on the extenuating circumstance can be sent to the student.\nAn extenuating circumstances panel may not make a recommendation which would change a penalty for academic misconduct imposed by a School, Department or an Academic Misconduct Committee e.g., a first sit cannot be offered for an assessment for which a penalty has been imposed.  If an extenuating circumstances panel makes a recommendation before the academic misconduct is detected, the academic misconduct finding will void a recommendation made by an extenuating circumstances panel.\n4.4.2   Extenuating circumstances outcomes\nPanels can determine one of the outcomes below:\n1. The claim is not approved:\ni. because the grounds are not acceptable within the University’s extenuating circumstances regulation.\nii. due to insufficient evidence. This would include, for example, evidence that does not cover the relevant period; is not from an approved source; is insufficient to support the claim of seriousness of impact, or is not provided within the required timeframe\niii. an extension or further attempt would take the student over the maximum period for stage or from initial registration, and an extension to this has not been approved.\n2. Where a School/Department permits for a given assessment, the claim is approved without evidence, because there are sufficient grounds for believing that the student’s ability to study and/or perform in the relevant assessment(s) has been adversely affected.\n3. The claim is approved, and sufficient evidence has been provided, because there are sufficient grounds for believing that the student’s ability to study and/or perform in the relevant assessment(s) has been adversely affected.\nFor students in their final year of study who have attempted and passed an assessment but have made a claim on the basis of affected performance, Schools/Departments may also list the following outcome:\n4. The claim is provisionally approved, and sufficient evidence has been provided, but a final decision on the outcome and any recommendations will be deferred to a meeting of the extenuating circumstances panel at the end of the academic session when the full impact can be assessed.\n4.4.3   Potential recommendations\nIf approved, the extenuating circumstances panel may make one or more of the following recommendations to the relevant Board of Examiners:\nFor Undergraduate students, Postgraduate students on taught programmes and Postgraduate Research students undertaking taught modules:\nRecommendations for coursework:\n1. Where the extenuating circumstances claim does not include evidence, and if permitted by the School/Department for the given assessment, grant an extension to the deadline set for a submission of up to 5 working days, taking into account other deadlines that the student has to meet. Students should be informed of any change to the timescale for the return of coursework and associated feedback in accordance with the Policy on Feedback to Students.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nPolicy on Feedback to students\n2. Where the extenuating circumstances claim includes sufficient evidence, grant an extension to the deadline set for a submission of up to 15 working days, taking into account other deadlines that the student has to meet. This should consider any support plan extensions for the same piece of work.  The two would be additive where the circumstances were distinct and where the timelines of the circumstances warranted this.  If that coursework has had previous extenuating circumstance extensions, the extenuating circumstances panels should take those into account (i.e. extensions on the same assignment would usually get progressively shorter).  Students should be informed of any change to the timescale for the return of coursework and associated feedback in accordance with the Policy on Feedback to Students.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nPolicy on Feedback to students\n3a. A student needing more than 15 working days of extension (due to an extenuating circumstance claim) is regarded as having been subject to serious circumstances that have impacted their work. To avoid on-going disruption to their studies, they will be required to submit their work in the resit period (or the School equivalent of this).\n3b. For a student needing more than 15 working days of extension (due to an EC claim) AND where a new assignment is required in the reassessment period, the panel may grant a first sit oppertunity.\nThe options available for both coursework and exams below are also available.\nFor exams:\n4a. For self-certification (i.e. without evidence) in the case of a first attempt, the only outcome available is to allow a further attempt as an equivalent sit  for which the mark gained will, subject to section 4(d)  of the Assessment Regulations and relevant Progression regulations (with or without attendance), count as the student’s first mark and therefore towards an award if relevant in the affected assessment(s). Note, the original assessment will not be marked/mark not released.  To not attend the further assessment would result in a mark of zero.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nAssessment regulations\n4b. For self-certification (i.e. without evidence) in the case of a reassessment, the only outcome available is to allow an additional attempt at the examination or coursework (at the same or equivalent assessment), in accordance with the relevant Progression regulations (with or without attendance).\n5a. For claims for short-term adjustments, grant a short-term arrangement that will be put in place for any in-person exams for the next assessment period (the outcome letter should expand on what this arrangement is). This is a temporary arrangement that will expire at the end of this assessment period.\n5b.  For claims for short-term adjustments, where there is insufficient time to make the arrangement for this assessment period, grant the student more time and/or rest breaks for any in-person exams for the next assessment period (the outcome letter should expand on what this arrangement is). This is a temporary arrangement that will expire at the end of this assessment period.\n5c. For claims for short-term adjustments, where there is insufficient time to make the arrangement for this assessment period, both of the above outcomes (clauses 1a and 1b) are available.\n6. For extenuating circumstance claims for exams with sufficient evidence, both of the above outcomes (clauses 1a and 1b) are available plus all of the outcomes listed below.\nThe options available for both coursework and exams below are also available.\nFor coursework and exams\n7. Recommend a different form of re-assessment, as determined by the School/Department, if the same or equivalent of the original is no longer possible, to assess whether the learning outcomes are achieved. Students have no automatic right to individual assessment of this nature. Approval from QSC will be required if this is outside regulation.\n8. Disregard an element of a module assessment and re-compute module mark based on completed components subject to regulation 6 of the Assessment Regulations (subject to PSRB requirements).\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nAssessment regulations\n9. Offer the student a repeat period of study and assessment (for which tuition fees will be payable) subject to this being an option supported by any sponsor, immigration legislation or legal obligation and to the University’s policy on Maximum Period from Initial Registration.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nStudent status changes and implications for your student visa\nMaximum period from initial registration for completion of studies\n10. In the case of final year students (this includes the taught stage for PGT students) when a further attempt at the assessment has not been possible before the relevant Examination Board is due to meet, disregard marks for specific affected module(s) to a maximum of 20 total credits across affected modules in computing the classification or credit weighted average for the final stage, subject to the provisions of the Regulations for Undergraduate, Taught Masters, Postgraduate Diploma and Postgraduate Certificate courses. Whilst a first attempt at the assessment must usually have been made for this option to be recommended, Section 6a of the Assessment Regulations should be taken into consideration at this point. The recommendation may only be applied at the end of the final year once the full marks profile is available, and is subject to PSRB requirements.  If a further first attempt has been offered earlier in the year as a result of an extenuating circumstances claim and it has not been possible for the student to undertake the assessment before the meeting of the Examination Board, the application of this recommendation may still be considered.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nAcademic regulations\nAssessment regulations\n11. When a student has experienced circumstances affecting their ability to study/take assessments in their final year of study, such that their final year performance is deemed unrepresentative of their academic profile, recommend that a case be made to QSC to for the purposes of recommending a degree classification outside regulations based on performance in earlier years.  This recommendation should only be used in exceptional circumstances for cases where there is no prospect of the student undertaking first attempts within a reasonable period of time, for example, in the case of chronic or terminal illness of the student or the dependent of a student.\nWhere options 5, 6, 7 or 8 have been applied no further consideration of the circumstances will take place at an Examination Board.  For instance, where the School has offered a first attempt but the student does not take that opportunity, the circumstances will not be taken into account at the final Examination Board.\nFor Postgraduate Research students at any stage of study the extenuating circumstances panel may:\neither\n(a) Grant an extension to the date set for the submission of the Progression Review report\nor\n(b) Grant an extension to the date set for the progression review meeting\nor\n(c) If circumstances occur that mean the progression review meeting cannot be completed, permit the PGR to undertake a further Progression Review as a First Sit.\n4.4.4\nAdditional recommendations\nExtenuating circumstances panels may also or alternatively make recommendations in response to an extenuating circumstances claim. Recommendations may include, but are not limited to:\na student is advised to attend a meeting with their Personal Tutor, the School Postgraduate Student Advisor (SPSA) and a Support and Wellbeing Officer (UNUK) or School Senior Tutor (UNNC) to consider the support options available, including the possibility of a voluntary interruption of study;\na student is advised to seek support from relevant support services, e.g. Counselling Service, Disability/Academic Support.\nreferral to the University’s Occupational Health Service (UNUK) or Health and Wellbeing Centre (UNNC).\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nVoluntary interruption of study\nShould a student fail to seek appropriate support following a recommendation from an extenuating circumstances panel, further claims made due to similar circumstances may be rejected.\nWhere students have a further attempt at an assessment for to an upheld extenuating circumstance, Schools/Departments can make a case to QSC to request a different form of re-assessment to assess whether the learning outcomes are achieved if the same or equivalent of the original is no longer possible.\n4.5 Withdrawal of Extenuating Circumstances claims\nWhere the conditions for a claim for Extenuating Circumstances no longer exist (e.g., cancelled jury service, recovery from illness or injury), or a student believes their performance in the assessment for which they requested the EC would no longer be strongly impacted, it is possible in some cases for the student to withdraw their EC claim, subject to the following conditions. These apply whether or not the student has received an outcome for the EC claim.\nNo EC claim may be withdrawn after the mark for that assessment has been released to the student.\nAn EC claim that is subject to Academic Misconduct investigation may not be withdrawn.\n4.5.1 Coursework EC Claims\nAll coursework EC claims may be withdrawn prior to the original coursework deadline. If a coursework EC claim is withdrawn, the usual lateness penalties will apply where the coursework is handed in after the original deadline.\n4.5.2 Exam EC Claim Withdrawal\nAll Exam EC claims may be withdrawn prior to the scheduled time of the Examination.\nAn Exam EC claim may also be withdrawn up to 5 working days after the Exam, provided the mark has not been released to the student.\n4.5.3 Procedure for EC Claim Withdrawal\nRequests to withdraw EC claims should be submitted via the ‘Ask a question’ option in the Student Enquiry Centre portal.\n5.

This information is primarily directed at role-holders and Schools but may also be of interest to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.School Examinations Officer Role\nIncludes:\nSchool responsibilities; specific duties; key documentation; Registry and Academic Affairs  UNUK, Academic Services Office UNNC, Student Registry Office - Exams and Assessent Team UNM\nSchools must have detailed procedures to ensure effective operation of assessments and exams. It is essential to define clearly the responsibilities of individuals and deadline dates. The procedure must cover:\nThe setting of examination papers, to ensure that examination papers (and marking schemes) are set, internally moderated, vetted by the external examiner (with appropriate changes made), printed and proof read at the appropriate time.\nThe marking of exam scripts and the processing of marks; to ensure that exam scripts are marked anonymously with appropriate checking of completeness and of marks addition, as well as undertaking al necessary moderation of marks. Similarly, the marks lists used by Boards of Examiners must be checked for accuracy.\nThe specific duties of a School Examinations Officer (or in the case of taught postgraduate examinations, the Examinations Officer for a particular taught postgraduate course), which may be one or multiple people, will depend on the organisational structure within the School. The School Examinations Officer, or delegates, will normally incorporate:\nExam delivery facilitation including:\nCoordinate the production of draft examination papers by module convenors for examinations in each semester with the production of the resit papers for resit examinations at the same time.\nLiaise with the External Examiner(s) to obtain feedback on the draft examinations papers, and to supply External Examiner(s) with relevant examples of student examination scripts and coursework, marks lists etc.\nCo-ordinate with RAA the production of final “camera ready copy” versions of the examinations papers to the approved university template (together with any additional special handout material). These originals are then passed to the Examinations Office for reproduction. Deadlines for submission of papers to the Examinations Office are circulated in advance.

        "content": "Policy on marking and grading - The University of NottinghamPolicy on marking and grading\nThis page contains the University's policy on marking and grading. Its content is applicable to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.1.0 Purpose - Overview of assessment policies and procedures\nIncludes:\nassessment process\nQuality assurance of assessment consists of several elements. These can be distinguished according to the different stages of the assessment process at which they operate:\nPre-assessment activities (including guidance for students and markers about the assessment activity; scrutiny of the assessment activity by internal or external examiners; calibration of standards among markers)\nThe assessment itself (including measures to assure the fairness of assessment conditions, such as invigilation, appropriate adjustments for students with support plans, and external review of exam papers)\nMarking (including use of clear standards,  anonymity of marking, and double marking where appropriate)\nInternal Moderation (checking that standards have been applied consistently during marking)\nMarks adjustment (adjustment of marks in light of a flaw in the assessment to maintain standards across cohorts)\nScrutiny by External Examiners\nApproval of marks by Exam Board\nThe appropriate combination of these elements of quality assurance will vary by discipline and assessment task, so some variation in practice between Schools is to be expected and not all elements will be appropriate to all assessments. Further information regarding moderation and marks adjustment can be found below.\n2.0 Key Principles\n2.1 Internal and external examiners\nIncludes:\nPostgraduate students with teaching responsibilities; responsibilities of Head of School\nAll assessments for programmes and modules leading to a University award must involve both one or more internal examiners and one or more independent external examiners. In addition, all members of academic staff will act as internal examiners in the subjects in their School.\nThe University of Nottingham policy on the appointment and responsibilities of External Examiners can be found online, and is linked below.\nThe School has a duty to ensure that any individuals acting as internal examiners who are not academic staff of the University, are fully briefed and have relevant experience and sufficient knowledge of their subject area to assess students' knowledge and skills. For more information, please consult the Policy on occasional teachers linked below.\nPostgraduate students with teaching responsibilities may also act as internal examiners. For more information, please consult the Policy on University of Nottingham students who teach.\nIn respect of any assessment carried out by postgraduate students with teaching responsibilities, Heads of School must ensure that:\nThey are supervised by a named member of academic staff\nThey are provided with training appropriate to their role in the assessment process\nAssessments that contribute to the final module/programme mark:\n1.\nAre moderated by a member of academic staff\n2.\nAre limited, as far as practicable, to those elements of assessment that do not contribute to the degree classification\nSuch assessments which do not contribute to the final module/programme mark are second marked where appropriate on a sampling basis by a member of academic staff.\nStudents must be informed by their School when and how they will receive results and the various stages of the process of distributing results.\n2.1.1 lndependent Assessors for Apprenticeship Programmes\nWhere a specific integrated apprenticeship programme’s End-Point Assessment plan makes references to other specified assessment roles within the marking and assessment team arrangements, the responsibilities noted below apply to all defined roles within that team.\nOn integrated apprenticeship programmes the End-Point Assessment serves as a final credit bearing module for the degree. It also constitutes the summative assessment for the apprenticeship award. Each specific End-Point Assessment plan outlines the final classification criteria for the apprenticeship award. Thus assessment of this module will need to meet the requirements of the published apprenticeship End-Point Assessment plan in addition to contributing to the degree award.\nThe Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IfATE) prescribes that the assessment of the End-Point Assessment is performed by suitably qualified Independent Assessors. These are appointed internally or externally and they will provide the grade for the overall outcome for the apprenticeship award. Dependent on the programme, the grade to contribute to the degree award may also be provided by the Independent Assessor/s, and thus may not be a member of University staff who is involved in the programme.\n2.2 Marking criteria\nIncludes:\nrole of School Boards; requirements of the School; Marking criteria examples; double-marking\nIt is recognised that there is a need for School Boards to conduct the assessment of students in a manner that is appropriate to individual disciplines and to the methods of assessment employed.\nAll Schools are required to have written marking criteria across the full range of marks available (0-100) which is published in School Handbooks. Marking criteria must include categories from 70% to 100% and 0% to 40%. Marking advice must be available to markers in relation to all forms of assessment used within the School/Department.\nThe School's marking criteria must be signposted in its programme specifications (Section C. Supplementary Regulations, 3. Assessment).\nIn pursuit of assessment practices that are fair, valid and reliable the University recognises double-marking (preferably \"blind\" where the first mark is not made known to the second marker) as good practice for all assessments where appropriate.\nFor apprenticeship programmes, to meet requirements outlined by the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IfATE), the criteria outlined in the specific End-Point Assessment plan for each apprenticeship standard must be followed. For more information please visit the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education website, via the link below.\nPermitted differences to local School policy on marking criteria may be required, for example providing acceptable tolerances in assessment word count.\n2.3 Moderation\nIncludes:\nrole of\nexternal examiners; sample size; moderation assessment report form\nModeration is the process of checking that standards have been applied correctly and consistently during the marking of an assessment. It is distinct from marking (including double marking) and from marks adjustment. Unlike double marking, moderation must not result in a change to the mark awarded to just one student; any changes to marks following moderation must be applied systematically to all affected students taking the assessment (e.g. all students who answered a given question). Unlike marks adjustment, moderation examines the application of standards to a unit of assessment, and does not compare marks across different cohorts.\nModeration is also distinct from the scrutiny of assessment by External Examiners. External Examiners will not be involved in the marking process as their role is to ensure that policies and regulations have been appropriately applied, that the assessment process is fair and robust and to ensure that standards applied are consistent with subject benchmark statements and other institutions.\nAll assessments that contribute to the determination or classification of an award must have been subject to moderation. Moderation must have been conducted by someone other than the first marker.\nAn absolute minimum number of student submissions for each assessment must be reviewed by the moderator. That number is determined by the number of students registered to take the assessment as follows:\nSubmissions to be included in moderation sample\nNumber of students registered to take assessment, N\nMinimum number of submissions to be included in moderation sample, M\n1-100\n5\n101-400\nN/20 (i.e. 5% of submissions)\n>400\n20\nSchools must decide for themselves the appropriate sample size for moderation for each assessment and it is expected that this will often exceed the minimum. This decision is based on the nature of the assessment, its weighting (i.e. number of credits), the number of first markers and their level of experience.\nSampling for moderation must be random but should include at least one submission from each mark range (where they exist): 0-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-100.\nSchools must have a clear and explicit written policy governing the moderation of marking which should be available to students (for example via School handbooks and School Community Moodle pages). All markers in a School must be clearly briefed on these processes each academic year.\nThese processes must specify:\nWhat proportion of work is sampled during moderation for each type of assessment (subject to the above minimum)\nWhether the sample must include work of certain kinds (e.g. whether special attention is paid to work marked as borderline)\nWhat should happen if a moderator believes that standards have not been applied correctly\nSchools must have a uniform system for fully recording the process of moderation so that examiners can clearly understand how moderation has occurred and what consequences have arisen from it. These records must be available to External Examiners as soon as possible and be tabled at relevant Examination Boards. An example of such a system is provided below from the Faculty of Arts:\nFor apprenticeship programmes, moderation will be in line with School policy, unless there are alternative requirements specific to the End-Point Assessment module. Moderation of this module will be undertaken by the appointed Independent Assessors or by internal staff who are independent of prior teaching. This will be determined and arranged locally.\n2.4 Marks adjustment\nIncludes:\nrole of external examiners; Report form for the use of marks adjustment\nA School is expected to consider data regarding marks on modules for which it has responsibility (for example, median mark and variance for each module) to identify possible issues with the delivery and assessment of the module prior to the Exam Board. Normally this analysis would also be taken into account in the School’s regular review of modules.\nWhere there has been a clear flaw in the assessment process (e.g. mistakes on a question paper), Schools have a responsibility to ensure that this does not have a significant impact on the fairness or robustness of the final marks. Where such a flaw is identified Schools should develop a suitable adjustment to be applied to all marks and report this to the External Examiners.\nWhere no potential flaws have been identified the summary report form linked below must be completed.\nWhere potential flaws have been identified by markers, reported by students or may come to light because of comparison of marks profiles (e.g. comparison of median mark and variance) with other modules taken by the same cohort or with the same module taken by previous cohorts, the marks adjustment report for the affected module(s) must be completed, linked in section 5 below.\nReview and sign off of the marks adjustment form (including nil returns) must take place at the Exam Board. Any approved adjustment and its rationale must then be communicated clearly to all students who took the module (normally via the module feedback report) and communicated to Quality and Student Management Systems Team (within Registry and Academic Affairs) for report to Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) using the forms below.\nThe module level information report must detail the rationale for marks adjustment; the method used; the method used to inform students; and any remedial measures implemented as a result of marks adjustment.  These forms must be appended to the summary form submitted. A separate report form should be used for each module where marks have been subject to adjustment. Schools are expected to submit an annual report even if there is a nil return. Where there is a nil return a single summary form must be used.\nFor more information, please email:\nss-qsc-cases@nottingham.ac.uk\nReports must be submitted at the same time as the main Examination Board recommendations in June/July (Undergraduate programmes) and by November (Postgraduate Taught programmes).\n2.5 Viva Voce examinations\nViva voce examinations may only be used as part of a documented assessment procedure and must not be used as part of the consideration of borderline candidates or in the final decision making process.\nThe only exception to this is where an external body requires that a Viva Voce examination is held as a separate assessment forming part of the decision-making process. In such a case the School must publish a written policy that must be included in the student handbook or otherwise drawn to the attention of students. This must address the following issues:\nThe name of the body that requires the viva voce examination to take place\nThe role of the viva in the assessment/classification process\nWho has the authority to call a student for a viva\nSelection criteria\nWhether attendance is compulsory or voluntary\nNotice given to a student\nProcedures followed and documents produced\nWhether a student can request a viva\nFormal records of all such vivas must be kept.\nSchools are encouraged to organise meetings for external examiners with representative groups of students as a mechanism for ensuring quality and standards control but this should not form part of the assessment process.\n2.6 Penalties and legibility\n2.6.1 Penalties\nUniversity policy on penalties for late submission of assessed coursework can be found online and linked below.\n2.6.2 Legibility\nUniversity policy on legibility of work submitted for assessment can be found online. For more information, please consult the information linked below:\n2.7 Anonymous marking\nIncludes:\nmarking by numbers\nFor formal written examinations the University operates a marking by numbers (or anonymous marking) system. For more information about the marking by number system, please consult the Marking by Number page.\nSchools must also ensure that coursework is anonymous at the time of marking where this is possible and appropriate for the educational aims\nSchools must ensure that clear statements of the responsibilities of those involved in computation, checking and recording of assessment data exist.\n2.8 Rounding\nIncludes:\ndegree classification; progression\n2.8.1 Degree Classification\nFor the purposes of classifying undergraduate degrees, marks will be rounded at the stages detailed under Degree Classification for each individual module.\nThe University convention on rounding of numeric marks for all awards is as follows:\nMarks must be rounded at two stages only:\nWhen two or more unit marks are computed (using a weighting formula), the result should be rounded into a single integer module mark\nWhen the overall weighted average mark has been computed, it should be rounded into a single overall integer mark, before a classification is assigned.\nRounding means that any mark of x.5 and decimal fractions above, becomes the next highest integer e.g. 69.5 is rounded to 70, 59.5 to 60, and so on. Decimal fractions below x.5 are rounded to the next lowest integer - for example, 69.4 is rounded to 69. For the purposes of rounding, the mark should be truncated and only the first decimal place is used (e.g. 69.45 becomes 69.4, which is rounded to 69).\nFollowing the rounding convention set out above, overall marks of 39.5, 49.5, 59.5, and 69.5 will be rounded to 40, 50, 60 & 70 respectively.\n2.8.2 Progression\nFor the purposes of progression, overall average marks will be rounded to the nearest integer so that marks of 29.5, 39.5 and 49.5 will be rounded to 30, 40 and 50 respectively. Decimal fractions below x.5 are rounded to the next lowest integer - for example, 69.4 is rounded to 69. For the purposes of rounding, the mark should be truncated and only the first decimal place is used (e.g. 69.45 becomes 69.4, which is rounded to 69).\n3.0 Related regulations, policies and procedures\nPolicy on occasional teachers\nPolicy on University of Nottingham students who teach\nAppointment and responsibilities of External Examiners\nInstitute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education\nPolicy on penalties for late submission of assessed work\nLegibility of work submitted for assessment\nMarking by number\nFor examples of marking criteria, please consult the following:\nMarking criteria examples\nExample moderation sysutem from the Faculty of Arts\nModeration assessment report form\nSummary Mark Adjustment form (where no adjustment is needed)\nSummary marks adjustment form\nMarks Adjustment form (when adjustment is needed)\nModule level marks adjustment form\n4.0 Version control table\nVersion control table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nReformatted to align with new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework based on content last modified on 23rd October 2023 and updated anonymous marking regulation.\nQSC\nAugust 2024\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n20 August 2024||"

        "intro": "This page contains the University's academic appeals code of practice. It is applicable to staff and students from the UK campuses only.",
        "content": "Academic Appeals Code of Practice - The University of NottinghamAcademic Appeals Code of Practice\nThis page contains the University's academic appeals code of practice. It is applicable to staff and students from the UK campuses only.1. Purpose\nThis code of practice provides information about the principles and approach that must be followed by students and staff when students wish to raise an academic appeal. It explains when a student has a right to make an appeal and the grounds under which appeals can be considered, provides information about each stage of the process, sets out expectations of those involved in submitting and responding to appeals, and provides details of the expected timescales. It also signposts students to the support available throughout the process and provides information about how to request adjustments to enable them to access the process fully.\nThe Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) is an independent body which runs a student complaints scheme for England and Wales, in line with the requirements of the Higher Education Act 2004. The University of Nottingham is a member of this scheme and this code has therefore been written in accordance with the\nOIA’s Good Practice Framework\nfor the handling of appeals.\n2. Scope\n2.1 Who does this code apply to?\nThe content of this code of practice is applicable to staff and students across the UK campuses. Details of who is considered a student under this procedure are in section 2.3 of this code.\nFor students and staff studying or working at University of Nottingham Ningbo China or University of Nottingham Malaysia, please consult the information on the relevant webpages:\nUniversity of Nottingham Ningbo China – academic appeals\nUniversity of Nottingham Malaysia – academic appeals\n2.2 Definitions\nAcademic appeal\nFor the purposes of this code, the university has adopted the definition used by the OIA, which is “a request for a review of a decision of an academic body charged with making decisions on student progress, assessment and awards.”\nSchool/department\nWhere references are made to a school/department, this is taken to mean any area within the university which is most appropriately placed to provide information and/or a response to a student’s appeal.\nRevised recommendation\nWhere references are made to a revised recommendation/upheld decision, this means a recommendation which revises an earlier decision of an academic body at the university charged with making decisions on assessment, progression and awards.\nFully registered\nAn individual who has completed the registration requirements set out by the university. Details of the registration steps required are detailed on the\nregistration webpages\n.\n2.3 Who can use this code of practice?\nFor the purposes of this code of practice, a student is:\nAn individual who is a current fully registered student of the university, or\nAn individual who has previously been fully registered as a student of the university.\nThis code of practice applies to students on both taught and research courses.\nStudents who are studying away from their home campus, for example on exchange to another University of Nottingham campus, should refer to the academic appeals code of practice/policy and procedure which applies to the campus where the issues they wish to raise have occurred.\nAny individual who is eligible to use this code (as outlined above) must submit their appeal within the timescales outlined in section 4.2 of this code.\nThe academic appeals process only considers appeals relating to decisions outlined in section 2.4 of this code. A student who has had their registration suspended by the university for other reasons and wishes to contest this decision should raise this via the appeals route for the policy/procedure under which the suspension was made (for example, the Student Code of Conduct) or where such an appeal route is not provided, via the student complaints process.\nA group of students may use this code of practice to make a group appeal, though it is normally the case that an individual appeal will allow for more appropriate consideration of a student’s particular circumstances. To raise a group appeal, one student must be identified as the main contact and have written consent from all others that wish to be named as part of the appeal. A group appeal can only be considered if all students named in the appeal are appealing on the same right and grounds and are seeking the same outcome. The Investigations and Resolution team will determine whether it is possible to consider a group appeal or whether cases submitted as a group appeal should be considered individually. If a student is aware that a group appeal is being raised but does not wish to be part of it, they can submit an individual appeal if they wish to do so.\nAnyone wishing to make an appeal is usually expected to do so themselves, unless they are part of a group appeal as detailed above.\nThe Policy on Communications with Third Parties\napplies to the academic appeals process. It provides information about circumstances in which a student may request for a third-party (such as a family member or friend) to represent them.\nAnonymous appeals will not be considered. Raising an appeal anonymously would prevent investigation of the circumstances raised in the appeal as well as communication and implementation of the outcome.\n2.4 Which decisions provide the right to appeal under this code?\nStudents have the right to appeal against the following final decisions of an academic body charged with making decisions on assessment, progression and awards:\n(a)\nThe conditions imposed and/or the requirement to take reassessments to progress to the next stage of a taught course or phase of research study.\n(b)\nA decision to terminate a student's current programme of study without an alternative lower qualification being awarded. This includes students whose programme of study is terminated but who are offered a transfer to another taught course or research degree.\n(c)\nA classification decision. This includes appeals against the class of honours degree awarded and the classification of other undergraduate and postgraduate awards.\n(d)\nA progression decision in situations where a student has met the progression requirements of their course but did not make the university aware of serious circumstances affecting their study before a progression examination board made its decision and is appealing to mitigate a possible effect on their future degree classification. This also applies to postgraduate research progression review outcomes. Such an appeal would be considered if submitted within the requirements of this code and the student demonstrates compelling reasons why they were unable to make the university aware of circumstances affecting their study prior to the examination board decision (for example, reasons associated with a disability or medically evidenced incapacity to engage with support procedures).\n(e)\nA decision not to award the qualification for which a student is registered and instead award a lower qualification or no qualification. This relates to decisions made at the end of a student's taught course or research degree.\n(f)\nA decision of a university Fitness to Practise Committee, Practice Assessment Panel or Special Cases Committee. This is relevant to students on professional courses who have been the subject of\nfitness to practise procedures\n.\n(g)\nThe outcome of an\nextenuating circumstances claim\n.\nWhere more than one right applies, a student may select multiple rights on their academic appeal form. A student can only submit one appeal against any decision which gives them the right to appeal as set out above.\n2.5 What issues are grounds for appeal under this code?\nOnly claims of at least one of the following circumstances will be considered as grounds for appeal:\n(a)\nParts of the documented assessment procedure were not applied (a procedural irregularity) and this procedural irregularity, which has disadvantaged the student, was significant enough to have materially affected the decision or recommendation made, rendering it unsound.\n(b)\nPrejudice or bias on the part of one or more of the examiners took place and can be substantiated with evidence, or there are grounds to support a reasonable perception of prejudice or bias.\n(c)\nThe decision-making body took a decision which no reasonable person would find comprehensible (a “manifestly unreasonable” decision). To apply this ground, the student must provide a substantive argument explaining why no reasonable person could have arrived at the decision that was made. Disagreement with a decision does not make it manifestly unreasonable.\n(d)\nThe student’s performance was materially affected by circumstances for which there is evidence which was not, and could not have been, made available to the examination board at the time of its original decision. The student will be required to explain why the circumstances could not have been brought to the university’s attention sooner. If evidence which relates to an extenuating circumstances outcome is submitted as an appeal prior to an exam board having taken place, this will be referred to the extenuating circumstances process for consideration and the appeal will be closed.\nWhere the student believes that more than one ground applies to their appeal, the student may select multiple grounds. The student submitting the appeal must establish the case and explain why they believe they have grounds for appeal.\n2.6 What issues are grounds for an appeal review request under this code?\nOnly claims of at least one of the following circumstances will be considered as grounds for an appeal review request:\n(a)\nProcedural irregularity in the handling of the appeal which has disadvantaged the student and was significant enough to have materially affected the decision or recommendation made, rendering it unsound\n(b)\nA compelling argument that the decision was not reasonable in the circumstances. Claims of this nature must be supported by evidence and a clear rationale for the unreasonable nature of the decision. Claims that simply amount to an expression of dissatisfaction with the decision will not be considered.\nWhere the student believes that more than one ground applies to their appeal review request, the student may select multiple grounds. The student submitting the appeal review request must establish the case and explain why they believe they have grounds for review.\n2.7 Exclusions from this code\nThe following circumstances will not be considered grounds for appeal:\n(a)   Perceived shortcomings in tuition, supervision or support.\nConcerns relating to the quality of teaching, supervision or other circumstances that relate to the delivery of a programme of study should be raised through the student complaints process  within the timescales set out in that process. Cases where complaints are upheld and there has been a clear impact on an academic outcome may lead to an academic conclusion e.g. allowing a student a further attempt at an assessment.\n(b)   Matters of academic judgement of an examination board or individual.\nThe student will not be permitted to argue the academic merits of their work. The student's assertion that the result unfairly reflects the merit of their work or their ability is not a ground of appeal.\n(c)   Disagreement with the actual mark awarded for a piece of assessed work except where grounds can be established above.\nIf a student wishes to have clarification about a mark received for an individual assessment or module, they are advised to contact their school/department or module convener directly. Errors in calculating or recording marks on which the original decision was made cannot be submitted as grounds for appeal unless these errors have been brought to the attention of the school/department but have not been resolved.\n(d)   Appeals against provisional marks.\n(e)   Any matters relating to circumstances affecting study which could have been raised before the meeting of the examination board or the confirmation of a postgraduate research progression review outcome.\nStudents cannot use the appeals process to request an outcome that would change a penalty for academic misconduct. Information about requesting a review of an academic misconduct finding and/or penalty can be found in the\nAcademic Misconduct Procedure\n.\n2.8 Principles\nThis code upholds the OIA principles of good practice for appeals procedures, which outlines that they should:\nBe accessible and clear\nBe fair, independent and confidential1\nBe inclusive\nBe flexible, proportionate and timely\nImprove the student experience.\nWhile information related to an academic appeal case will be kept as confidential as possible, information provided as part of an appeal usually needs to be shared with relevant staff members in schools/departments and services across the university to allow for full consideration of any issues or circumstances raised.\nAppeals will be treated seriously and students will not suffer any disadvantage or recrimination as the result of making an appeal in good faith. Appeals made frivolously, vexatiously or with malice will not be investigated.\nThe university is committed to ensuring that appeals are handled in accordance with this code. Occasionally, it may be sensible for the university to deviate from procedure if strict adherence to it could give rise to perceptions of prejudice or bias.\nAppeals form part of the university's process of quality review and improvement and are considered as providing valuable feedback rather than criticism. We will widely publicise information about procedures to students and staff, and all schools and central services are required to provide a link to them via their websites.\nThe university will not accept or investigate appeals which it considers to be in breach of the standards set out in the\nUnacceptable Behaviour Policy\n.\nStudents will be notified as early in the process as possible if the remedy sought within the appeal is beyond what the university can reasonably provide or what is in its power to provide.\nIt is important for students to note that the Office of the Independent Adjudicator cannot consider matters which are or which have been the subject of court proceedings. Similarly, the university reserves the right to decline, suspend or to discontinue an appeal made under this code if legal proceedings are commenced and the claim concerns the same subject matter as the appeal.\n3. Roles and responsibilities\n3.1 Role and responisbilities of those submitting and responding to appeals\nStudents\nTo raise appeals promptly and in accordance with the timescales of this code.\nTo conduct themselves responsibly and treat the process and members of the university involved in the process with respect at all times, in line with the Unacceptable Behaviour Policy. Where a student is being represented by a third party, the Policy on Communication with Third Parties also applies.\nStudents’ Union Advice Team\nTo provide independent support and guidance to students wishing to use this code.\nSupporters (for students)\nWhere a supporter is attending a meeting with a student at any part of the academic appeals process, they may take notes on the student’s behalf, make representations on their behalf and ask questions, but may not answer questions on their behalf.\nInvestigations and Resolution Team\nTo administer the handling of appeals and assess their eligibility for consideration\nTo provide information to students on the process and progress of their appeal\nTo provide advice and training to staff members on the process\nTo issue outcome responses to appeals within the timescales of this code (or advise the student of any delays)\nTo ensure that those appointed to respond to appeals are free from prejudice and bias or a reasonable perception of prejudice and bias\nTo review and update this code of practice\nTo maintain records of appeals and to provide reports to university committees as required.\nThose receiving, considering and making decisions on appeals at both the appeal and appeal review stages, including staff in the Investigations and Resolution team making decision at the initial triage stage of an appeal/appeal review\nTo approach an appeal/appeal review with an open mind and to act fairly, proportionately and reasonably in relation to the appeal/appeal review\nTo uphold the university’s principles of equality, diversity and inclusion\nTo access training opportunities related to the appeals process and keep up to date with developments to this code of practice\nTo declare any potential conflicts of interest\nFor staff in schools/departments at the appeal stage: to prepare a school/department response form and submit this to the Investigations and Resolution team within the timescales of this code (or advise of any delays)\nAt appeal review stage: to ensure that consideration of an appeal review is carried out, which may be delegated (as set out in section 4.1 of this code).\nQuality and Standards Committee\nTo approve this code as part of the university’s Quality Manual and to have oversight of the activity of the Investigations and Resolution team\nTo receive and review reports relating to appeal handling at the university.\n3.2 Support for students\nWe encourage students to seek advice from Students' Union Advice at any stage in the appeals process, including seeking advice on how to present their case effectively. The Students’ Union is independent from the university and has specialists who can provide impartial advice.\nIf a student needs adjustments to support them to access any stage of the academic appeals process, they should email the Investigations and Resolution team at\nacademic-appeals@nottingham.ac.uk\noutlining what adjustments would be useful.\nStudents have the right to bring a supporter to meetings arranged during any stage of the appeals process. The supporter must be one of the following:\nAn education adviser from Students’ Union Advice\nA fellow student\nA member of staff\nA union representative (e.g. BMA, RCN).\nThe university provides a number of support services which may be useful to students making an appeal under this code. Information about the services available can be found on the Wellbeing Service webpages. This includes pastoral support available from Support and Wellbeing.\nWellbeing service webpages\n4. Procedural steps\n4.1 Overview of the academic appeals process\nThe academic appeals process has six potential stages. A case may not need to progress through all stages of the process. Decisions about which stages a case goes through will be led by the relevant case handler from the Investigations and Resolution team in conjunction with colleagues in schools/departments where appropriate. In the event of any disagreement between parties regarding these stages, the final decision will be made by the Head of Casework.\nThe potential stages of the appeals process are:\n4.1.1 Initial assessment of the case by the Investigations and Resolution team\nOn receipt of an appeal, the Investigations and Resolution team will determine the eligibility of the appeal in accordance with this code. The appeal will be closed if the student:\nhas not completed the appeal form fully*\nhas not supplied any or relevant evidence*\ndoes not have the right to appeal\nhas requested an outcome that is not available within the academic appeals process or is beyond what the university can reasonably provide/has the power to provide*\nhas submitted the appeal outside of the timelines stated in section 4.2 of this code\nhas not adequately explained why the circumstances claimed establish grounds for appeal\nhas previously submitted an appeal relating to the same grounds.\n*If the student has not completed the appeal form in full or has not supplied any or relevant evidence, or if the outcome requested by the student is not available within the academic appeals process, the student will be invited to revise and resubmit their appeal. The deadline for resubmission will be set by the Investigations and Resolution team.\nIf the circumstances claimed by the student should be addressed under a different policy, the student will be informed and guided to the correct policy and the appeal case will be closed.\nThe Investigations and Resolution team has the remit to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant further consideration of the case and to close appeals which do not warrant such consideration. As part of this, they may seek further information from a school/department, service or from the student.\nAs a result of the initial assessment stage, one of the following actions will be taken:\nThe case will be closed and the student will be guided to the appropriate policy for consideration of the topics being raised.\nThe case will be closed if it has not met the requirements set out in this code and the student will be provided with an explanation of which requirements have not been met and advised of further steps available to them.\nThe case will be accepted for further consideration and progressed for a school/department response.\n4.1.2 School/department response\nIf the initial assessment of the case by the Investigations and Resolution team finds that further consideration of the appeal is required, the case will be forwarded to the relevant school/department and information will be gathered regarding the case. The school/department’s response will usually be submitted on a school/department response form within 10 working days. The school/department should address in full the points raised in the student's appeal form, referencing relevant policies and procedure where applicable. The response should either make a revised recommendation (sometimes called an\nupheld\ndecision) or confirm the original decision (sometimes called a not\nupheld/rejected\ndecision). In either case, the school/department should provide a written response and any relevant evidence. A revised recommendation (upheld decision) will not necessarily result in the outcome requested by the student (for example where the school/department believes an alternative outcome is more appropriate).\nAs a result of the school/department response stage, one of the following actions will be taken:\nThe case will be upheld if it establishes grounds for appeal and a revised recommendation will be issued. The student will be provided with an explanation of why grounds have been established and the actions to be taken by both the university and the student following this decision.\nThe case will not be upheld if it does not establish grounds for appeal. The student will be provided with an explanation of why grounds have not been established and will be advised of further steps available to them, including information about submitting an appeal review request.\nThe case will be referred to an Academic Appeal Panel.\n4.1.3 Academic Appeal Panel\nIf the triage process demonstrates that the case is not suitable for a school/department decision, the student’s appeal will be considered by an Academic Appeal Panel, which acts with the fully delegated authority of Senate. This could be for a number of reasons, which might include:\nThe school/department does not wish to make a revised recommendation as it does not believe grounds have been established, but the case handler disagrees\nThe school/department and case handler agree that a revised recommendation should not be made but the case would benefit from further consideration by a panel\nThe case is too complex to be suitable for a decision at the school/department stage alone.\nA panel might also consider an appeal case where the student rejects a revised recommendation issued as a result of their appeal.\nDetermination for the suitability of a case for referral to a panel is made by the Investigations and Resolution team.\nThe Academic Appeal Panel will comprise of three members of the\nAcademic Appeals and Academic Misconduct Committee\n. No member of the panel will have had any prior involvement in the case. A member of the Investigations and Resolution team will be present throughout proceedings to provide guidance with respect to matters of policy and precedent but they will not be a member of the panel. This individual may act as note taker or may be accompanied by a further member of staff acting as note taker.\nThe Academic Appeal Panel will base its decisions on the information and evidence submitted by the student and the response provided by the school/department. The panel may request further evidence from the student and/or the school/department, if required. This is a paper-based consideration and neither the student nor the school/department is entitled to attend. The student will be sent a copy of the paperwork to be considered by the panel and invited to highlight any factual inaccuracies in the information provided by the school/department so that this can be brought to the attention of the panel. New evidence/information will not be considered at this stage unless there is compelling evidence that it was not previously available or it is provided in support of a claim of factual inaccuracy.\nThe Academic Appeal Panel may:\nReject the appeal and confirm the original decision\nUphold the appeal and accept the revised recommendation submitted by school/department\nUphold the appeal and refer the case back to the school/department to reconsider\nUphold the appeal and substitute another decision, rejecting the revised recommendation submitted by school/department (if applicable)\nRefer the case to an Academic Appeal Hearing.\nThe Academic Appeal Panel cannot change marks or degree classifications.\nThe Academic Appeal Panel may attach conditions to these decisions, such as the requirement for the student to provide medical evidence. Clear instructions will be provided about the consequences of failing to comply with these conditions.\nThe decision of the Academic Appeals Panel, reasons for the decision and any findings of fact will be conveyed to the student, normally within five working days of the meeting.\n4.1.4 Academic Appeal Hearing\nPlease read the Academic Appeal Hearing procedure.\nAcademic Appeal Hearing procedure.\nAn Academic Appeal Hearing acts with the full delegated authority of Senate. It has the power to require members of staff of the university to attend, give evidence, and answer questions.\nA case may be referred to a hearing if one or more of the following grounds apply:\nThere is a compelling argument that the student’s case would be adversely affected by not being able to present their argument in person\nAn Academic Appeal Panel is unable to agree on a course of action\nThe appeal case concerns a student who has already attended a panel or committee to address issues of professional competence. This is likely to apply to cases concerning a Fitness to Practise Committee, Practice Assessment Panel or Special Cases Committee, for example.\nDetermination for the suitability of a case for referral to a hearing is made by the Investigations and Resolution team.\nThe student will receive a written invitation to the hearing from the Investigations and Resolution team at least 10 working days in advance of the hearing. The student will be asked to confirm in writing whether they intend to attend.\nThe Academic Appeals Hearing panel will comprise of three members. Two of the members will be academic staff members of the Academic Appeals and Academic Misconduct Committee and one of these will act as chair. The third member will be a student delegate nominated by the Students’ Union. If no student delegate is available, the hearing panel shall instead include a full-time officer from the Students’ Union. Where no student delegate or full-time officer is available, the third member of the panel will be a further member of the Academic Appeals and Academic Misconduct Committee.\nFor a hearing considering an appeal against the decision of an Academic Appeal Panel or a committee convened to address issues of professional competence, such as a Fitness to Practise Committee, Practice Assessment Panel or Special Cases Committee, the hearing panel will include two additional staff members of the relevant faculty. In the case of fitness to practise, one of the additional members must be a clinically active member of the same professional discipline as the student.\nNo member of the hearing panel will have had any prior involvement in the case.\nThe student will be notified of the names of the members of the hearing panel and should notify the Investigations and Resolution team immediately of any conflict of interest so that the membership of the panel can be reviewed. The student should inform the Investigations and Resolution team at least five working days prior to the hearing if they do not wish, or wish to insist, that a student delegate is included in the hearing panel. If the student wishes to insist that a student delegate is included in the hearing panel, this may result in a delay to the hearing taking place while a suitable student delegate is found.\nA member of the Investigations and Resolution team will be present throughout proceedings to service the hearing panel and provide guidance with respect to matters of policy and precedent but they will not be a member of the hearing panel. This individual may act as note taker or may be accompanied by a further member of staff acting as note taker.\nThe student is entitled to bring a supporter as detailed in section 3.2 of this code. The student must inform the Investigations and Resolution team of the name and status of their supporter at least five working days prior to the hearing. The student may be asked to choose a different supporter if, for example, it is perceived that the chosen supporter may cause a conflict of interest or if their presence may prejudice the meeting.\nThe school/department will be requested to send a representative to attend the hearing. This representative should have detailed knowledge of the case, the student’s academic career and the arrangements for the student’s course.\nThe hearing panel, the student and the school/department representative will all have access to the same evidence.\nThe hearing panel will base its decisions on the information and evidence submitted. The hearing panel can:\nReject the appeal and confirm the original decision\nUphold the appeal and accept the revised recommendation submitted by the school/department\nUphold the appeal and refer the case back to the school/department to reconsider\nUphold the appeal and substitute another decision, rejecting the revised recommendation submitted by the school/department (if applicable).\nWhere a hearing panel is making a decision related to a fitness to practise case, the only options available to the panel are i) and iii) above.\nThe decision taken at the Academic Appeals Hearing, reasons for the decision and any findings of fact will normally be conveyed to the student by the Investigations and Resolution team within five working days of the hearing.\n4.1.5 New evidence\nIn both instances outlined below, the Investigations and Resolution team will determine if new evidence can be accepted for consideration. Students can normally only submit new evidence for consideration on one occasion (either before the appeal outcome or within the 10 working days following the appeal outcome). Multiple submissions of new evidence will not normally be accepted.\nNew evidence prior to receiving an outcome:\nStudents are expected to provide all relevant evidence at the point of submitting their appeal; if evidence is provided after submission of their appeal form, they must explain why this evidence was not previously available for it and demonstrate its relevance to the case for it to be considered. Evidence which could have been included in the original appeal will not normally be considered.\nIf a student has new evidence to provide in support of their appeal, they must do this as soon as possible by emailing\nacademic-appeals@nottingham.ac.uk\n.\nIf the new evidence is accepted for consideration, the Investigations and Resolution team will arrange for the evidence to be provided to those considering the appeal at its current stage. If the new evidence is not accepted, the student will be provided with an explanation of why they have not established that the evidence was not available previously and/or is materially relevant to their case.\nNew evidence following receipt of an outcome:\nA student can submit new evidence which was not previously available up to 10 working days after receiving their appeal outcome. If the student requires an extension to this timeframe, they can request this as detailed in section 4.2 of this code. New evidence must be submitted using the new appeal evidence form, which will support the student to explain:\nThe relevance of the new evidence to their case\nWhy this evidence was not previously available.\nIf the new evidence is accepted for consideration, the appeal will return to the school/department stage of the academic appeal process for reconsideration.\nIf the new evidence is not accepted for consideration, the student will be provided with an explanation of why they have not established that the evidence was not available previously and/or is materially relevant to their case. The student has no further route to request consideration of new evidence within this code but can submit an appeal review request. A new deadline for the submission of a review request will be set by the Investigations and Resolution team in line with the timescales in section 4.2 of this code.\n4.1.6 Appeal review request\nIf a student is dissatisfied with the formal outcome of their appeal, they may be able to request a review of this decision on the grounds detailed in section 2.6 of this code.\nNew arguments or criteria not included in the original appeal will not be considered as part of a review request. Requests that amount simply to an expression of dissatisfaction with the decision without establishing grounds for review will not be considered. The review exists to assess the reasonableness of the decision made based on the case made by the student in their appeal submission or whether there is any evidence of a procedural irregularity in the handling of the appeal stage.\nThe request for review should be submitted to the Investigations and Resolution team. The request should be submitted within 10 working days of the student being notified of the outcome of their original application to appeal. Review requests submitted after this period will only be considered in the most exceptional circumstances and where there is good reason, supported by evidence, for the late submission.\nOnly written cases made using a fully completed academic appeal review request form, supported by evidence which establishes one or more of the grounds outlined in section 2.6 of this code, will be accepted. Reviews of decisions made at the initial assessment stage or the school/department response stage will be conducted by a member of the Academic Appeals and Academic Misconduct Committee. Reviews against the decision of an Academic Appeal Panel or Academic Appeal Hearing will be conducted by the Director of Registry & Academic Affairs or their nominee.\nThe review stage will not usually consider the issues afresh or involve further investigation. The reviewer will have access to all documentation considered by the decision-making body and may request further information from relevant parties. The reviewer can:\nClose the review request and require reconsideration by the original decision-maker if the outcome letter provides insufficient information for the reviewer to reach a conclusion on the case\nClose the review request and require consideration of the case by an Academic Appeal Panel if the case was dismissed at the initial assessment stage\nUphold the claim and substitute a decision on behalf of the university\nReject the claim and issue the student with a completion of procedures letter.\nAfter the internal university processes have been exhausted, students have the opportunity to have their case independently reviewed by the\nOIA\n.\n4.2 Expected time limits\nThe OIA Good Practice Framework stipulates that the handling of appeals will normally be completed within 90 calendar days of the submission of the appeal and its acceptance into process. This timeframe requires students to meet any deadlines set by the university. Delays in information or evidence being provided will require this timeframe to be extended. If a student requires an extension to any of the timescales set out in this section, they must request this from the Investigations and Resolution team prior to the deadline by emailing\nacademic-appeals@nottingham.ac.uk\n.\nWhere the table below refers to working days, this means working days at the University of Nottingham which can be checked on the\nbank holidays and closure days webpage\n. If a student requires support with calculating the latest date on which their appeal can be submitted, they can email the Investigations and Resolution team at\nacademic-appeals@nottingham.ac.uk\n.\nExpected time limits\nStudent\nInvestigations and Resolutions Team\nOutcome\nAppeal\nAppeal should be raised within 30 working days of the decision the student is appealing (right to appeal)\nWill acknowledge receipt of appeal within five working days of submission\nThe outcome of an appeal and any appeal review request will normally be communicated within 90 calendar days of the appeal being received. If this is not possible, the staff member responding to the appeal will provide an explanation for the delay and an alternative timescale will be issued to the student.\nAppeal review\nAppeal review request should be raised within 10 working days of the outcome of the original appeal\nWill acknowledge receipt of appeal within five working days of submission\nThe outcome of an appeal and any appeal review request will normally be communicated within 90 calendar days of the appeal being received. If this is not possible, the staff member responding to the appeal will provide an explanation for the delay and an alternative timescale will be issued to the student.\nWhen the appeal review request stage has been completed, the student has completed the university’s academic appeals process and can request a completion of procedures letter if they wish to raise their appeal with the Office of the Independent Adjudicator.\nOIA\nAppeal case should be raised with the OIA (who will refer to it as a ‘complaint’) within 12 months of the date of issue of the Completion of Procedures letter\nNo direct involvement with student\nVariable\nIf a student fails to proceed within the given deadlines of the academic appeals process, they may not be able to progress through the internal academic appeals mechanisms of the university.\nAppeals submitted outside of the timescales stipulated in this code will only be considered in the most exceptional circumstances and where there is good reason, supported by evidence, for the late submission.\n4.3 Standard of evidence\nIndependent, reliable evidence is normally required to accompany an academic appeal. Details of the types of evidence often submitted as part of an appeal can be found in section 4.4 of this code.\nEvidence submitted as part of an appeal should:\nWhere written by appropriately qualified professionals who are independent of the student, be on headed paper and signed and dated by the author. Evidence presented by email may be acceptable if the email has been sent by the author from the official domain name of the author's organisation. Students should note that services, such as medical services or university support services, are unlikely to be able to provide evidence if the student has had no engagement with that service.\nConfirm that the circumstances were witnessed on the relevant date as opposed to being reported retrospectively. Evidence reported by the author as being informed retrospectively about the circumstances will not be acceptable evidence.\nBe in English. It is the student's responsibility to provide supporting documentation and any translation should be undertaken by an accredited translator (e.g. be a member of the Association of Translation Companies). Any associated costs must be met by the student.\nMedical certificates supplied by online doctors will not be accepted.\nAs part of an appeal, staff can consider evidence supplied by other members of university staff known to the student, such as a personal tutor, a staff member from the Residential Experience team, or a staff member from the Support and Wellbeing team.\nThe university reserves the right to take such steps as are deemed necessary to verify the evidence submitted, without prior notification. Where the university is unable to authenticate the material to its satisfaction, the evidence may not be accepted. The university reserves the right to request sight of original documents. If there is evidence that a student has fraudulently presented documentation to the university, the matter will usually be referred for consideration under the academic misconduct or disciplinary processes.\n4.4 Responsibilities of students when raising an appeal\nAppeals\nBefore submitting an appeal, a student should:\nCheck that that they have both the right to appeal and grounds for appeal in accordance with this code.\nDiscuss the matter with an appropriate person in their school/department, which may resolve the student’s concerns or clarify their understanding about how a mark for an assessment was given or how a classification has been calculated, for example.\nAn appeal must be submitted by completing the academic appeal form which can be accessed through the\nappeals webpages\n. If a student needs adjustments to support them to access the university’s appeals process, they should email the Investigations and Resolution team at\nacademic-appeals@nottingham.ac.uk\noutlining what adjustments would be useful.\nWhen raising an appeal, students must:\nClearly outline the reasons for their appeal, including details of the outcome they are seeking. Appeals that do not outline a clear rationale will not be accepted for consideration. If the case handler from the Investigations and Resolution team (who carries out the initial triage of appeals cases to confirm they are eligible under this code) believes that a submission is unclear or unnecessarily long, the student will be asked to resubmit the form in a manner than enables proper consideration of the appeal to take place.\nGather evidence in support of their appeal, ensuring that they include important dates, times and other details that are needed to assess the eligibility of their appeal. Appeals without relevant evidence will not be accepted for consideration. This could include, but is not limited to, the following:\nA timeline of events (if they cannot remember the exact dates, the student can provide a rough timeline of events)\nReference to relevant policies, procedures and/or regulations\nLetters/emails\nEvidence from others, such as independent medical evidence, reports by professionals or witness statements\nScreenshots\nThe outcome of an investigation under another University of Nottingham process.\nProvide all evidence relevant to their appeal at the point of submitting their academic appeal form. Evidence submitted after the submission of an appeal form will only be accepted under the circumstances outlined in section 4.1.5 of this code. The evidence must meet the standard of evidence outlined in section 4.3 of this code.\nComplete the academic appeal form in full.\nAppeals must be submitted as soon as possible and within the timescales set out in section 4.2 of this code.\nReview requests\nAn appeal review request must be submitted by completing the academic appeal review request form which can be accessed through the appeals webpages. If a student needs adjustments to support them to access the university’s appeals process, they should email the Investigations and Resolution team at\nacademic-appeals@nottingham.ac.uk\noutlining what adjustments would be useful.\nWhen raising an appeal review request, students must:\nIdentify the ground(s) under which they are submitting the request (as set out in section 2.6 of this code)\nProvide evidence in support of their claim. A student who wishes to provide evidence that was not provided as part of the student’s original appeal should not submit this as a review request and should instead follow the procedural steps set out in section 4.1.5 of this code under the heading ‘New evidence’ and must explain why this evidence was not available at the time of their original appeal.\nComplete the academic appeal review request form in full.\nAppeal review requests must be submitted within the timescales set out in section 4.2 of this code. The outcome to the student’s original appeal will confirm the date by which they must submit their request for an appeal review.\n4.5 Responsibilities of staff responding to appeals\nInitial assessment stage\nOn receipt of an appeal, the Investigations and Resolution team will undertake an initial evaluation to check that the appeal is submitted under the right procedures, within the appropriate deadlines, and in the required format with supporting evidence. The Investigations and Resolution team will administer the appeal and will provide information and support regarding the process to students and staff at all stages.\nAfter the initial assessment of the case, one of the actions listed in section 4.1.1 of this code will be taken by the Investigations and Resolution team.\nSchool/department response\nOn receipt of an appeal case requiring a school/department response, the receiving individual in the school/department will ensure that consideration of the appeal case is carried out. The consideration may be carried out by any member of staff who has received appeals training.\nThe school/department should submit their response on a school/department response form, usually within 10 working days, addressing the points in the student’s appeal form in full and referencing relevant policies and procedures where applicable. The response will either make a revised recommendation or confirm the original decision. The form will be returned to the Investigations and Resolution team alongside any relevant evidence.\nIf the appeal is not proceeding to an Academic Appeal Panel or Academic Appeal Hearing, the Investigations and Resolution team will issue the appeal outcome to the student and advise them of further steps available to them, including submitting an appeal review request.\nAcademic Appeal Panel\nIf an appeal is being considered by an Academic Appeal Panel, the Investigations and Resolution team will be responsible for arranging for the panel to take place in accordance with section 4.1.3 of this code and will service the panel.\nIf a member of the Academic Appeals and Academic Misconduct Committee selected to be a member of the panel has prior knowledge of the case and/or there is a conflict of interest, they should inform the Investigations and Resolution team immediately so that an alternative member of the committee can be identified if required.\nThe outcome of a panel will be issued to the student by the Investigations and Resolution team, normally within five working days of the meeting.\nAcademic Appeal Hearing\nIf an appeal is being considered by an Academic Appeal Hearing, the Investigations and Resolution team will be responsible for arranging for the hearing to take place in accordance with the procedural steps in section 4.1.4 of this code and will service the hearing.\nIf an individual selected to be a member of the hearing panel has prior knowledge of the case and/or there is a conflict of interest, they should inform the Investigations and Resolution team immediately so that an alternative hearing panel member can be identified if required.\nThe school/department representative attending the hearing is responsible for ensuring they have detailed knowledge of the case, the student’s academic career and arrangements for the student’s course.\nThe outcome of a hearing will be issued to the student by the Investigations and Resolution team, normally within five working days of the hearing.\nAppeal review request\nOn receipt of an appeal review request, the Investigations and Resolution team will undertake an initial evaluation to check that the review request is submitted under the right procedures, within the appropriate deadlines, and in the required format with supporting evidence. The Investigations and Resolution team will administer the review request and will provide information and support regarding the process to students and staff at all stages. Where a student is requesting a review of a decision made by a member of the Investigations and Resolution team at the initial assessment stage, a different member of the team will conduct the initial assessment of the appeal review request.\nAfter the initial assessment of the review request, one of the following actions will be taken by the Investigations and Resolution team:\nThe case will be rejected if it has not met the requirements set out in this code. The Investigations and Resolution team will provide the student with an explanation of which requirements have not been met and they will be advised of further steps available to them.\nThe case will be accepted for review and the Investigations and Resolution team will organise for the case to be considered by a reviewer, in line with section 4.1.6 of this code.\nOn receipt of an appeal review case, the reviewer will proceed to conduct the review. If the reviewer has prior knowledge of the case and/or there is a conflict of interest, they should inform the Investigations and Resolution team immediately, which will organise for an alternative reviewer to consider the case if required.\nThe reviewer will submit their response to the Investigations and Resolution team. The reviewer can:\nClose the review request and require reconsideration of the original appeal by the original decision maker if the outcome letter provides insufficient information for the reviewer to reach a conclusion on the case\nClose the review request and require consideration of the original appeal case by an Academic Appeal Panel, if the case was dismissed at the initial assessment stage\nUphold the review request and substitute a decision on behalf of the university\nReject the review request and require the student to be issued with a completion of procedures letter.\nThe outcome of a review request will be issued to the student by the Investigations and Resolution team.\n5. Internal, statutory or regulatory requirements\n5.1 Office of the Independent Adjudicator\nAs required by the OIA, if the university is unable to resolve an appeal to the student’s satisfaction, and there are no further steps available to the student, the Investigations and Resolution team will issue a formal completion of procedures letter within 28 days of the outcome being determined. This provides formal confirmation that the student has exhausted the internal procedure and is required for their case to be considered by the OIA. The OIA operates externally to the university. It will not normally look at a case unless and until all relevant internal procedures have been exhausted. Further information is available from the OIA website.\nOIA website\n5.2 Recording and monitoring of appeals\nIt is important that appeals are monitored in order to improve the student experience. The Investigations and Resolution team will record and provide reports to indicate the nature of appeals and outcomes. Such reports will:\nFeed into the monitoring and evaluation procedure at various levels: department, school, faculty and university\nFeed directly into appropriate university-wide committees\nAssist in identifying problems and trends across the university\nForm the basis of positive publicity in demonstrating that identified issues have been resolved\nBe made available to the Students' Union.\n5.3 Review of this code\nThis code will be reviewed every two years by the Head of Casework in Registry and Academic Affairs.\n6.

        "content": "Student Complaints Code of Practice - The University of NottinghamStudent Complaints Code of Practice\nThis page contains the University's code of practice on student complaints. Its content is applicable to staff and students across the UK campuses.1. Purpose\nThis code of practice provides information about the principles and approach that must be followed by students and staff when students wish to raise a complaint. It explains the types of complaints that can be considered, provides information about each level of the process, sets out expectations of those involved in submitting and responding to complaints, and provides details of the expected timescales.\nThe Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) is an independent body which runs a student complaints scheme for England and Wales, in line with the requirements of the Higher Education Act 2004. The University of Nottingham is a member of this scheme and this code has therefore been written in accordance with the\nOIA’s Good Practice Framework\nfor the handling of complaints.\n2. Scope\n2.1 Who this code applies to\nThe content of this code of practice is applicable to staff and students across the UK campuses. Details of who is considered a student under this procedure are in section 2.3 of this code.\nFor students and staff studying or working at University of Nottingham Ningbo China or University of Nottingham Malaysia, please consult the information on the relevant webpages:\nUniversity of Nottingham Ningbo China - student complaints\nUniversity of Nottingham Malaysia - student complaints\n2.2 Definitions\nComplaint\nFor the purposes of this code, the university has adopted the definition used by the OIA, which is “an expression of dissatisfaction by one or more students about a university’s action or lack of action, or about the service provided by or on behalf of the university”.\nFeedback\nA student may provide feedback, which will be considered by a school, department or service when reviewing its policies and operations, without using this code. Students are encouraged to provide feedback to the appropriate school/department representative, the appropriate department of the students’ union, student staff forums (SSF) or service provider in a prompt and constructive manner.\n2.3 Who can use this code of practice?\nFor the purposes of this code of practice, a student  is:\n• An individual who is a current fully registered student of the university, or;\n• An individual who has previously been fully registered as a student of the university and is complaining about events that occurred before they left the university.\nThis code applies to postgraduate research students in their capacity as a student. Any complaints linked to an employment status at the university that is held at the same time as a postgraduate research student’s studies (for example as a demonstrator or teacher) should be dealt with under relevant staff procedures.\nApplicants wishing to make a complaint should consult the following:\nInformation about admissions feedback, appeals and complaints.\nApprentices wishing to make a complaint should consult the following:\nApprentice Complaints Policy\nApprentice Complaints Procedure\nA group of students may use this code of practice to make a collective complaint. To raise a group complaint, one student must be identified as the main contact and have written consent from all others that wish to be named as part of the complaint. If a student is aware that a group complaint is being raised but does not wish to be part of it, they can submit an individual complaint if they wish to do so.\nAnyone wishing to make a complaint is usually expected to do so themselves, unless they are part of a group complaint as detailed above.\nThe Policy on Communications with Third Parties\napplies to the student complaints process. It provides information about circumstances in which a student may request for a third-party (such as a family member or friend) to represent them.\nAnonymous complaints will not be considered unless there are exceptional reasons to do so, supported by evidence. In many circumstances, raising a concern anonymously could impede the investigation and communication of the outcome.\n2.4 What issues are grounds for a complaint under this code?\nFor a complaint to be considered under this code, the student raising the complaint is usually expected to demonstrate the direct impact that the issues being raised have had on them. If a student has more general concerns, these can be raised as feedback with the relevant school/department or service.\nThe subject of the complaint should relate specifically to one or more of the following or similar issues:\n• Failure of the university to meet obligations including those specified in course and student handbooks\n• Misleading or incorrect information in prospectuses, promotional material or other information provided by the university\n• Concerns about the delivery of a programme, teaching, supervision or administration (where applicable, this includes delivery which is provided by a partner institution. In the first instance, the student would normally be expected to follow the partner institution’s complaints procedures )\n• Poor quality of facilities, learning resources or services provided directly by the university\n• Complaints involving other organisations or contractors providing a service on behalf of the university\n• Events causing significant disruption to the normal delivery of a course, service or other aspect of the student experience, such as industrial action or a public health emergency\n• Concerns about the application of a policy or procedure, such as those relating to financial support, immigration processes or welfare support.\nCases where complaints regarding one or more of the issues above (or similar) are upheld and there has been a clear impact on an academic outcome may lead to an academic conclusion – for example, to allow a student a further attempt at an assessment.\nComplaints relating to allegations of bullying, harassment or victimisation by members of staff will be considered in line with the\nDignity at Nottingham\nprinciples.\n2.5 Exclusions from this code\nThe following areas are not grounds for complaint under this code.\n1. Challenges to the academic judgement of a member of staff and/or school.\nDissatisfaction with a mark and/or the academic judgment of the university is not grounds for a complaint. The Office of the Independent Adjudicator will not interfere with the operation of a university’s academic judgement.\n2. Cases where some or all of the content is better suited to the academic appeals process.\nWhere a student raises issues which are better considered under the academic appeals process, they will be directed to that process and their case will not be considered through the complaints process. Where a student raises issues which do not fall neatly into the category of either complaint or academic appeal, the university will notify the student which specific issues will be considered under the complaints process and direct the student to the academic appeals process for the remaining issues.\n3. Disagreement with a policy/regulation rather than its application.\nIn this instance, the matter should be raised by the student with the relevant student representative to be raised at the student staff forum (SSF) or another appropriate committee or group.\n4. Non-academic matters raised by students who are studying by collaborative arrangement and who are studying away from the university at partner institutions.\nThese issues should be raised with the partner institution.\n5. A matter of public interest which may be better suited to the Whistleblowing (Public Interest Disclosure) Code.\nInformation about the Whistleblowing Code can be found here:\nWhistleblowing (Public Interest Disclosure) Code\n6. Areas with separate complaints procedures, such as applications to the University and University of Nottingham Students’ Union.\nComplaints about these areas should be raised in line with the relevant procedure.\n7. Complaints about the behaviour of students\nComplaints about the behaviour of students towards other students are within the scope of the Student Code of Conduct.\nStudent Code of Conduct\n2.6 Principles\nThis code upholds the OIA principles of good practice for complaint procedures, which outlines that they should:\n• Be accessible and clear\n• Be fair, independent and confidential\n• Be inclusive\n• Be flexible, proportionate and timely\n• Improve the student experience.\nComplaints  should be treated seriously and students must not suffer any disadvantage or recrimination as a result of making a complaint in good faith.\nIn all cases, it is desirable that complaints are resolved as soon as possible between the relevant parties, and that the formal process (from level 2 onwards) is only started if that fails. Evidence of an attempt at early resolution (level 1) will be required before the formal process can begin.\nMediation can be a useful means of resolving matters of complaint where the parties involved are willing to engage voluntarily in the process in an attempt to work things out. The university may make an offer of mediation to students at any stage of the complaint process.\nThe university is committed to ensuring that complaints are handled in accordance with this code. Occasionally, it may be sensible for the university to deviate from procedure if strict adherence to it could give rise to perceptions of prejudice or bias.\nThe university will not accept or investigate complaints which it considers to be in breach of the standards set out in the Unacceptable Behaviour Policy.\nUnacceptable Behaviour Policy\nComplaints form part of the university's process of quality review and improvement and are considered as valuable feedback. The university will widely publicise information about this code to students and staff, and all schools/departments and central services are required to provide a link to it via their websites.\nStudents  will be notified early in the process if the remedy sought within the complaint is beyond the power of the university to deliver.\nIt is important for students to note that the Office of the Independent Adjudicator cannot consider matters which are or which have been the subject of court proceedings. Similarly, the university reserves the right to decline, suspend or to discontinue a complaint under the student complaints process if legal proceedings are commenced which concern the same subject matter as the complaint.\n3. Roles and responsibilities\n3.1 Roles and responsibilities of those submitting and responding to complaints\nStudents\n• To raise complaints promptly and in accordance with the timescales of this code.\n• To conduct themselves responsibly and treat the process and members of the university involved in the process with respect at all times, in line with the\nUnacceptable Behaviour Policy\n. Where a student is being represented by a third party, the\nPolicy on Communication with Third Parties\nalso applies.\nStudents’ Union Advice Team\n• To provide independent support and guidance to students wishing to use this code.\nSupporters (for students)\n• A supporter may take notes on the student’s behalf, make representations on their behalf and ask questions, but may not answer questions on their behalf.\nInvestigations and Resolution Team\n• To administer the handling of level 2 and 3 complaints and assess their eligibility for consideration.\n• To provide information to students on the process and progress of their complaint.\n• To provide advice and training to staff members on the process\n• To issue outcome responses to level 2 and 3 complaints within the timescales of this code (or advise the student of any delays)\n• To ensure that those appointed to investigate and respond to complaints are free from prejudice and bias or a reasonable perception of prejudice and bias.\n• To review and update this code of practice.\n• To maintain records of complaints and to provide reports to university committees as required.\nThose receiving and considering a complaint at the early resolution  stage (level 1)\n• To approach a complaint with an open mind and to act fairly, proportionately and reasonably in relation to the complaint\n• To issue outcome responses to level 1 complaints within the timescales of this code (or advise the student of any delays) and provide a copy to the Investigations and Resolution team\n• To uphold the university's principles of equality, diversity and inclusion.\n• To access training opportunities related to the student complaints process and keep up to date with developments to this code of practice.\nInvestigating Officer\n• To declare any potential conflicts of interest  before commencing an investigation.\n• To approach an investigation with an open mind and to act fairly, proportionately and reasonably in the course of the investigation.\n• To uphold the university's principles of equality, diversity and inclusion.\n• To access training opportunities related to the student complaints process and keep up to date with developments to this code of practice.\n• To prepare an investigation report and submit this to the Investigations and Resolution team within the timescales of this code (or advise of any delays)\nThose making decisions on complaints (such as Head of School/Department or Service, Faculty Pro Vice Chancellor or Registrar)\n• To declare any potential conflicts of interest.\n• To ensure that an investigation is carried out. The investigation may be delegated.\n• To approach a complaint with an open mind.\n• To make timely, fair,  and proportionate and reasonable decisions and uphold the university's principles of equality, diversity and inclusion.\nQuality and Standards Committee\n• To approve the Student Complaints Code of Practice as part of the university’s Quality Manual and to have oversight of the activity of the Investigations and Resolution team.\n• To receive and review reports relating to complaint handling at the university.\n3.2 Support for students\nStudents are encouraged to seek advice from the Students’ Union Advice team at any stage in the process, including seeking advice on how to present their case effectively. The students’ union is independent from the university and has specialists who can provide impartial advice.\nIf a student needs adjustments to support them to access any stage of the student complaints process, they should email the Investigations and Resolution team at\nstudentcomplaints@nottingham.ac.uk\noutlining what adjustments would be useful.\nStudents have the right to bring a supporter to meetings arranged during any stage of the complaints process. The supporter must be one of the following:\n• An education adviser from Students’ Union Advice\n• A fellow student\n• A member of staff\n• A union representative (e.g. BMA, RCN).\nFurther information can be found in the roles and responsibilities section of this code.\nThe university provides a number of support services which may be helpful to students making a complaint under this code. Information about the services available can be found on the Wellbeing Service webpages . This includes pastoral support available from Support and Wellbeing.\nWellbeing Service Webpages\n4. Procedural steps\n4.1 Overview of the student complaints process\nThe student complaints process has three levels which must be completed in order. These are:\n• Level 1: early resolution at a local level\n• Level 2: formal consideration by a head of school/service\n• Level 3: paper-based review by a Faculty Pro Vice Chancellor/Registrar (UK)\nAfter the internal university processes have been exhausted, complainants can request to have their complaint independently reviewed by the OIA.\nOIA website\n4.2 Expected time limits\nThe OIA Good Practice Framework stipulates that the handling of complaints will normally be completed within 90 calendar days of the start of the formal stage (level 2). This timeframe requires students to meet any deadlines set by the university. Delays in information or evidence being provided will require this timeframe to be extended. If a student requires an extension to any of the timescales set out in this section, they must request this from the Investigations and Resolution team prior to the deadline by emailing\nstudentcomplaints@nottingham.ac.uk\n.\nThe table below refers to working days. This means working days at the University of Nottingham, which can be checked on the\nbank holidays and closure days webpage\n. If a student requires support with calculating the latest date on which their complaint can be submitted, they can email the Investigations and Resolution team at\nstudentcomplaints@nottingham.ac.uk\n.\nExpected time limits\nStudent\nInvestigations and Resolution Team\nOutcome\nLevel 1\nComplaint should be raised within 30 working days of the cause for complaint\nNo involvement\nA response will normally be communicated within 30 working days of the complaint being received. If this is not possible, the staff member investigating the complaint will provide an explanation for the delay and an alternative timescale will be issued to the complainant.\nLevel 2\nComplaint should be raised within 30 working days of the outcome of the level 1 complaint\nWill acknowledge receipt of complaint within five working days of submission\nA response will normally be sent within 30 working days of receipt of the complaint form. This will be communicated by the Investigations and Resolution team. If this is not possible, an explanation for the delay will be provided and an alternative timescale will be issued to the complainant.\nLevel 3\nComplaint should be raised within ten working days  of the outcome of the level 2 complaint\nWill acknowledge receipt of complaint within five working days of submission\nA response will normally be sent within 20 working days of receipt of the complaint form. This will be communicated by the Investigations and Resolution team. If this is not possible, an explanation for the delay will be provided and an alternative timescale will be issued to the complainant. At this point, the student has completed the university’s complaints process and can request a Completion of Procedures letter if they wish to raise their complaint with the Office of the Independent Adjudicator.\nOIA\nComplaint should be raised within 12 months of the date of issue of the Completion of Procedures letter\nNo direct involvement with complainant\nVariable\nIf a student fails to proceed within the given deadlines of the complaints process, they may not be able to progress through the internal complaints mechanisms of the university.\nComplaints submitted outside of the timescales stipulated in this code will only be considered in the most exceptional circumstances and where there is good reason, supported by evidence, for the late submission.\n4.3 Standard of evidence\nIndependent, reliable evidence is normally required to accompany a student complaint at levels 2 and 3. Evidence can be provided at level 1 (early resolution) and students are encouraged to provide any evidence that is available to them; however, it is not required in order to make a level 1 complaint. Details of the types of evidence often submitted as part of a complaint can be found in section 4.4 of this code.\nEvidence  submitted as part of a complaint should:\n• Where written by appropriately qualified professionals who are independent of the student, be on headed paper and signed and dated by the author. Evidence presented by email may be acceptable if the email has been sent by the author from the official domain name of the author's organisation. Students should note that services, such as medical services or university support services, are unlikely to be able to provide evidence if the student has had no engagement with that service.\n• Confirm that the circumstances were witnessed on the relevant date as opposed to being reported retrospectively. Evidence reported by the author as being informed retrospectively about the circumstances will not be acceptable evidence.\n• Be in English. It is the student's responsibility to provide supporting documentation and any translation should be undertaken by an accredited translator (e.g. be a member of the Association of Translation Companies). Any associated costs must be met by the student.\nAs part of a complaint, staff can consider evidence supplied by other members of university staff known to the student, such as a personal tutor, a staff member from the Residential Experience team, or a staff member from the Support and Wellbeing team.\nThe university reserves the right to take such steps as are deemed necessary to verify the evidence submitted, without prior notification. Where the university is unable to authenticate the material to its satisfaction, the evidence may not be accepted. The university reserves the right to request sight of original documents.  If there is evidence that a student has fraudulently presented documentation to the university, the matter will usually be referred for consideration under the academic misconduct or disciplinary processes.\n4.4 Responsibilities of students when raising a complaint\nLevel 1: Early resolution\nStudents should try to resolve a complaint by raising it directly and promptly with the person/department concerned. In some circumstances, they may prefer to approach a different member of staff e.g. personal tutor, module convenor; however, if this staff member is not well placed to consider the complaint, they should support the student to contact the most relevant person/department.. If  they are not sure who to raise a complaint with, there is a list of key contacts available on the complaints webpages.\nAlthough level 1 complaints can be raised verbally or in writing, students are encouraged to put their complaints in writing to ensure that there is a record of the complaint and to allow both the student and the recipient to refer to the concerns raised.\nWhen raising a level 1 complaint, students must:\n• State that they are raising a level 1 complaint in accordance with this code.\n• Clearly explain what the problem is, the impact it has had, and the outcome they are seeking.\nThe university provides a level 1 complaint form. While students are not required to use this to make a level 1 complaint, it is a helpful tool that supports them to clarify the key parts of their complaint and the outcome they are seeking.\nComplaints must be raised as soon as possible and, at the latest, within the timelines referred to in section 4.2 of this code.\nLevel 2: Formal consideration by Head of School/Service\nIf a student is dissatisfied with the outcome of their level 1 complaint, they can escalate their complaint to level 2.\nLevel 2 complaints must be raised by completing the level 2 complaint form which can be accessed through the complaints webpages. If a student needs adjustments to support them to access the university’s complaints process, they should email the Investigations and Resolution team at studentcomplaints@nottingham.ac.uk outlining what adjustments would be useful.\nWhen raising a level 2 complaint, students must:\n• Provide a clear explanation of how they attempted to resolve their complaint informally at level 1. This should include:\no A specific date (or dates) when they raised their complaint\no A named member of staff to whom they reported their complaint\no Details of why the complaint was not resolved to their satisfaction at level 1.\no Copies of any written communication or evidence of completion of the level 1 stage of the complaints process.\n• Clearly outline the reasons for their complaint, including details of any impact, and the outcome they are seeking. Complaints that do not outline a clear rationale will not be accepted for consideration. If the Investigations and Resolution team case handler (who carries out an initial review of complaints to confirm they are eligible under this code) believes that a submission is unclear or unnecessarily long, the student will be asked to resubmit the form in a manner that enables proper consideration of the complaint to take place.\n• Gather evidence in support of their complaint, ensuring that they include important dates, times and other details that are needed to assess the eligibility of their complaint. Complaints without relevant evidence will not be accepted for consideration. This could include, but is not limited to, the following:\no A timeline of events (if they can’t remember the exact dates, the student can provide a rough timeline of events)\no Reference to relevant policies, procedures and/or regulations\no Letters/emails\no Evidence from others, such as independent medical evidence, reports by professionals or witness statements\no Screenshots\no The outcome of an investigation under another University of Nottingham process.\n• Provide all evidence relevant to their complaint at the point of submitting your level 2 complaint form. The evidence must be:\no Clearly labelled and referenced within their level 2 complaint form\no Written in English (or translated into English)\no Be on headed paper and signed and dated by the author, or have been sent from the official domain name of the author’s organisation (when evidence has been written by appropriately qualified independent professionals)\nLevel 2 complaints must be raised as soon as possible and, at the latest, within 30 working days of the receipt of the outcome of their level 1 complaint.\nIf you a student is making a subject access request (SAR) as part of a complaint, they are expected to submit this as soon as possible after the outcome of their level 1 complaint and they must provide evidence of submission as part of their level 2 complaint. Information about how to make a subject access request can be found on the\ndata protection webpages\n. The investigation of a level 2 complaint cannot be delayed while a student awaits for the outcome of a SAR, but the student can provide relevant information they receive from a SAR after submitting their complaint form.\nThe complaint will be investigated by someone who has not previously been involved in the issues that have been raised. This is to ensure that each case is looked at by someone without prior knowledge of the circumstances who can consider the issues being raised in an objective way.\nLevel 3: Review by Faculty Pro Vice Chancellor/Registrar\nIf a student is dissatisfied with the outcome of their level 2 complaint, they can escalate their complaint to level 3 on one or more of the following grounds:\n• they believe that a procedural irregularity has occurred in the handling and/or the investigation of the level 2 complaint\n• they are in possession of additional evidence which may have affected the outcome at level 2 but was unavailable at the time of the original level 2 investigation\n• they have a compelling argument to demonstrate that the outcome at level 2 was unreasonable. Claims of this nature must be supported by evidence and a clear rationale for the unreasonable nature of the decision.\nClaims that amount simply to an expression of dissatisfaction with the decision  will not be considered.\nLevel 3 complaints must be raised by completing the level 3 complaint form found on the complaints webpage. If a student needs adjustments to support them to access the university’s complaints process, they should contact email studentcomplaints@nottingham.ac.uk outlining what adjustments would be useful.\nWhen raising a level 3 complaint, students must:\n• Identify the ground(s) under which they are making their complaint (as set out above).\n• Provide evidence in support of their claim. Where evidence was not provided as part of their level 2 complaint, they must explain why this evidence was not available at the time of their level 2 complaint.\nLevel 3 complaints must be raised as soon as possible and, at the latest, within the timescales set out in section 4.2 of this code. The student’s level 2 complaint outcome will confirm the date by which they must submit their level 3 complaint form.\n4.5 Responsibilities of staff responding to complaints\nLevel 1: Early resolution\nStaff dealing with complaints are encouraged, whenever practical, to meet with the student to establish the precise cause of dissatisfaction, to explore the remedy sought by the student and to foster a mutual understanding of the issues involved. If a staff member receiving a complaint believes they are not well placed to consider the complaint, they should support the student to contact the most relevant person/department.\nWhen responding to a level 1 complaint, staff must:\n• Listen to the complaint and try to resolve it in a straightforward, reasonable and prompt manner\n• Keep notes of any meetings and a record of the agreed outcome, and ensure these are shared with the student\nStaff are required to provide a written response to a level 1 complaint. This response must  confirm that this is the outcome of their level 1 complaint and advise the student of their opportunities to escalate their complaint to level 2 of the complaints process if they remain dissatisfied . Staff should provide details about the steps that have been taken to consider and seek to resolve the complaint. The response must be shared with the Investigations and Resolution team.\nComplaints must be responded to as soon as possible and, at the latest, within the timescales set out in section 4.2 of this code.\nLevel 2: Formal consideration by Head of School/Service\nOn receipt of a level 2 complaint, the Investigations and Resolution team will undertake an initial evaluation to check that the complaint is submitted under the right procedures, within the appropriate deadlines, and in the required format with supporting evidence. The Investigations and Resolution team will administer the complaint and will provide information and support regarding the process to complainants and staff at all stages.\nThe complaint will be referred to the appropriate person in the school, usually the head of school/service. If the subject of the original complaint is the head of school/service, another head of school/service or their line manager will conduct the review. If the subject of the complaint is a member of the University Executive Board (UEB), another member of UEB will conduct the review.\nThe head of school/service or other relevant individual (as outlined above) will ensure that an investigation is carried out.  The investigation may be delegated to an appropriate member of staff. The investigation and its outcome must be fair and reasonable. If an investigator who has been allocated by the head of school/service has prior knowledge of the case and/or there is a conflict of interest, they should inform the Investigations and Resolution team or the head of school/service immediately.\nIt may be appropriate for the investigator to meet with the student and/or other parties named in the paperwork. Should the investigator wish to meet with the student, they will contact them to propose this course of action and organise a meeting. The complainant will be offered the opportunity to bring a supporter to this meeting as outlined in section 3.2 of this code.\nA report of the investigation will be prepared before a written response is provided to the complainant. The report and associated appendices will be provided to the student with the outcome letter.\nIf the head of school/service partially or fully upholds the complaint, they may decide on whatever redress they think appropriate, bearing in mind the outcome sought by the student.\nUpon conclusion of the level 2 complaint, the student will be notified of the opportunity to escalate their complaint to level 3 of the complaints procedure.\nAll outcome responses to level 2 complaints will be issued by the Investigations and Resolution team.\nLevel 3: Review by Faculty Pro Vice Chancellor/Registrar\nOn receipt of a level 3 complaint form, the Investigations and Resolution team will undertake an initial evaluation to check that the complaint is submitted within the appropriate deadlines, meets the grounds for a level 3 review and is in the required format with supporting evidence. A complaint without adequate grounds and evidence will be dismissed.\nIf the student provides evidence to support the stated grounds, the complaint will be referred to the faculty Pro Vice Chancellor or Registrar for review. If the level 2 complaint was reviewed by the faculty Pro Vice Chancellor, it will be referred to the Pro Vice Chancellor of a different faculty. Where the level 2 complaint was considered by a head of service, the Level 3 complaint will be considered by the Registrar, rather than a faculty Pro Vice Chancellor.  The Registrar/Pro Vice Chancellor may appoint an appropriate nominee to undertake the review on their behalf.\nThe review stage will not usually consider the issues afresh or involve further investigation. However, in the case that new evidence has been submitted and accepted, additional investigation may be required. In reaching a decision, the reviewer is expected to be fair and reasonable.\nIf the complaint is successful and the level 2 decision is amended, in full or in part, both the student and the head of school/service will receive a written explanation of the decision.\nIf the complaint is unsuccessful and the level 2 decision is confirmed, the student will receive a written response giving reasons and a ‘Completion of Procedures’ letter (see section 5.1 of this code) will be issued.\nAll outcome responses to level 3 complaints will be issued by the Investigations and Resolution team.\nDecisions regarding liability for fees or financial reimbursement\nThe refund/waiver  of a student’s tuition fees or payment of compensation can be considered as an appropriate outcome at any stage of the complaints process, including the early resolution stage (level 1).\nWhere a school/department or service deems the refund or waiver of a student's tuition fees or a payment of compensation to be the appropriate redress following a complaint made by a student, the liability for the fees will transfer to the school/department or service against which the complaint was made. Payments or waivers must be processed via the Investigations and Resolution team. To organise a payment or waiver, details of the relevant circumstances and any associated documentation, including authorisation from the head of school/department or service, must be forwarded to studentcomplaints@nottingham.ac.uk so that they can be forwarded to the Director of Registry  and Academic Affairs or a nominee, who has authority on behalf of the Registrar to approve such requests.\nWhere a refund, waiver or payment of compensation is imposed on a school/department or service as a result of a level 3 complaint or OIA outcome, the school/department or service will be notified as soon as the outcome has been determined.\n5. Internal, statutory or regulatory requirements\n5.1 Office of the Independent Adjudicator\nOnce the internal complaints process has been completed, if a student is still not satisfied with the outcome and there are no further steps available to them, they will be issued with a formal ‘Completion of Procedures’ letter. This provides a formal confirmation that they have exhausted the internal complaints procedure and is required before a complaint may be considered by the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA).\nThe OIA operates externally to the university. It will not normally look at a complaint unless and until all relevant internal complaints procedures have been exhausted. Further information is available on the OIA website.\nOIA website\n5.2 Recording and monitoring of complaints\nIt is important that complaints are monitored in order to improve the student experience. The Investigations and Resolution team will record and provide reports to indicate the nature of complaints and complainants, and resultant action. Such reports will:\n• Feed into monitoring and evaluation at various levels (department, school, faculty, and university)\n• Feed directly into appropriate university-wide committees\n• Assist in identifying problems and trends across the university\n• Form the basis of positive publicity, in demonstrating that identified issues have been resolved\n• Be made available to the students’ union.\n5.3 Review of this code\nThis code will be reviewed every two years by the Head of Casework in Registry and Academic Affairs\n6.

        "content": "Policy on feedback to students - The University of NottinghamPolicy on feedback to students\nThis page contains the University's policy on feedback that is provided to students for pieces of assessed work, including coursework and written examinations. Its contents are applicable to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Overview\nSchools/Departments must ensure that where feasible, appropriate feedback is provided to students on assessed work in order to facilitate improvement and promote learning. Feedback must be related to the assessment criteria, in order to help students identify areas for improvement as well as commending them for evident achievement.\nSchools/module convenors must specify the nature and extent of feedback they can expect and whether this will be accompanied by the return of assessed work.\nThe records which are used as part of its marking procedure could also be used for providing feedback.\nSchools/Departments must ensure that feedback is provided at times which are appropriate to enable the student to benefit from such feedback.\nWhere students undertaking work are encouraged to seek comment prior to formal submission, clear guidance must be given as to when it is no longer appropriate for staff to continue giving feedback.\n1. Assessed coursework\nIncludes:\nprovision and format; marks location; extenuating circumstances; returning of marks; definition of work day\nFeedback should be given on all forms of coursework where practicable. Feedback should be written and supplemented where appropriate with oral comments.\nWhere coursework has been submitted electronically, feedback must be provided electronically. The only exception to this is where a member of staff has a reasonable adjustment.\nWhere appropriate, it is good practice for marks for coursework not submitted electronically to be fed back on electronically. An exception would be made where a member of staff has a reasonable adjustment.\nMarks for all coursework, however submitted, must be uploaded to Moodle.\nMarked coursework and associated feedback will normally be returned to students within 20 working days\n1\nof the published submission deadline for Qualifying Stage modules and 15 working days for all other undergraduate and postgraduate taught modules. This will be 28 working days for UoNO learners. Students submitting work before the published deadline should not have an expectation that early submission will result in earlier return of work.\nWhere coursework will not be returned within the time frames above for good reason - for example, in circumstances where a student has been granted an extension of the deadline, unexpected absence of the module convenor or assigned marker, lengthy pieces of coursework and others - students must be informed of the timescale for the return of the coursework and associated feedback.\nWhere a student has claimed extenuating circumstances and has been granted a further attempt at an assessment, resulting in the mark being expunged from the record, this procedure will not normally apply.\nIn normal circumstances, marked coursework and associated feedback must be returned to students before the main University examination periods. If necessary, coursework can be returned after the main University examination periods. However it is likely that this will then be outside of the normal time frames (see above). It is good practice to inform students in advance of submission of the timescale for the return of the coursework and associated feedback. If it is necessary for students to receive feedback on coursework during the exam period, then it must be returned without the mark. Summative marks should only be given after the exam period.\nFor these purposes, coursework refers to all assessments other than unseen written examinations taken during the main University examination periods.\n1\nA working day is a day when the University is open for normal business. Weekends and University Closure Days are not regarded as working days. However, periods outside of University term (vacation periods) are regarded as working days (unless they are weekends or University Closure Days). Similarly, the booking of Annual Leave by a staff member does not change the status of a day being a working day.\n2. Written examinations\nIncludes:\nexamination script instructions; student opportunities to receive satisfactory feedback; optional examination feedback form\nHard copies of examination scripts must not be returned to students. However wherever it is feasible and helpful for students to discuss their examination performance with staff and with reference to marked scripts, this can be facilitated. The purpose of this is for feedback, not to challenge the marks awarded.\nAll students must be given a clearly advertised opportunity to receive feedback on their examinations. Where no other suitable mechanisms exist for providing feedback the module convenor must supply on the web a generic feedback report (which need be no more than one side of A4) for each module to the relevant group of students which:\nHighlights examination questions on which students' performance could be improved\nSuggests strategies for improving performance in those questions\nGives general comments about technique.\nIf you require a template, please use or consult the following:\nExamination feedback form - template\n3. Release of marks\nIncludes:\nfeedback upon request; expectations on Schools/Departments; timings\nEach candidate is entitled to be informed of the marks they have been awarded in all examinations and assessments which contribute to the award of a degree or other qualification. This includes all Foundation Year, Qualifying and Parts I, II and III marks.\nAll students failing a module must be given feedback on request which, as a minimum (though only where relevant), comprises a breakdown of their marks question-by-question.\nSchools/Departments must ensure that students are informed how and when marks/results will be released to them.

This information and its associated documentation may be of interest for staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Overview\nPeriodic Assurance and Continuous Enhancement Reviews (PACERs) are UoN's periodic quality assurance (QA) and enhancement (QE) review process. It is a periodic programme of peer review, in which academic Schools and Departments of UoN focus on Quality Assurance and Quality Enhancement in their Education and Student Experience (ESE) provision.\nThe philosophy underpinning the PACER is one of peer support, collaboration and educational enhancement through the sharing of good practice in ESE, teaching and curriculum leadership. Through the review visit and the subsequent report and follow up, the process aims to enable colleagues in Schools/Departments who are facing challenges in specific areas of their provision to learn from peers with expertise or proven good performance in those same areas.\nThe remit of the PACERs is limited to UG and PGT programmes, but the impact of potential changes can affect other provision such as Apprenticeships or PGR delivery. All recommendations should consider the wider impact they have on delivery to avoid unintended negative consequence\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the PACER process is:\nTo ensure that Schools/Departments are providing a high-quality student experience, that safeguards academic standards and delivers good outcomes for all students.\nTo ensure that the programmes delivered by Schools/Departments are aligned with the Office for Students (OfS) B Conditions and are adherent to sector norms.\nTo support colleagues in the performance of their Education and Student Experience activity in a constructive and expertise-driven manner.\nTo highlight where improvements to provision are possible in order to enhance the student learning experience and encourage the development of more inclusive approaches to Teaching and Learning\nAssessment of core teaching and learning activities\n1. In advance of each academic session, a review of performance in key ESE indicators is conducted by the PACER Planning Board of the Schools currently in the pool of Schools/Department eligible for review. The membership of this board should include;\nPVC for ESE (chair)\nAPVC for Teaching and Curriculum Leadership\nDirector of Careers and Employability\nChair of Quality and Standards Committee\nAssociate Director, Educational Excellence Team\nUNM Representative (as agreed by the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning)\nUNNC Representative (as agreed by the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning)\nHead of Policy and Operations, Deputy Registrars\nCurriculum Nottingham Representative\nAny other members as agreed by the chair, including delegates.\n2. Example indicators that will normally factor into the review of performance are listed below and are predominantly the external measures of our performance, as monitored by the UNUK regulator the OfS;\nStudent Outcomes (Including Continuation, Completion, Progression, Attainment, TEF-specific subject level outcome data)\nStudent Experience (National Student Survey, SEM, PTES)\nQuality measures, e.g number of QSC cases (agreed by QSC)\n3. The review of performance should look longitudinally at the data sets. A single year’s performance should not alone be considered a trigger for review. Nor should a single year’s performance be considered as a reason why a review is not justified.\n4. The PACER Chair, as nominated by the PACER Planning Board, will recommend a review panel for each visit. As far as possible, the constitution of the panel should be matched to the needs of the visit, based on the factors that contributed to the decision to conduct the review. For example, if a School’s Assessment and Feedback scores in NSS and Awarding Gaps are the focus of the review, then it may draw on those with provable expertise in those fields.\nKey documentation\nPACER Technical Document\nFor more information, please contact the team at: periodic-review@nottingham.ac.uk\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n24 July 2024||"

This information is only relevant to staff and students based at the UK campus.Where a specific integrated apprenticeship programme’s End-Point Assessment plan makes references to other specified assessment roles within the marking and assessment team arrangements, the responsibilities noted below apply to all defined roles within that team.\nOverview and Scope\nThe University of Nottingham as an apprenticeship End Point Assessment Organisation (EPAO) is required to deliver an independent, objective assessment of knowledge, skills and behaviours as set out in the relevant assessment plan that accompanies each apprenticeship standard.\nThis regulation applies to those apprenticeship End Point Assessments undertaken where the University is the EPAO  and applies to all staff taking part in or supporting an EPA. This includes individuals involved with any aspect of the delivery of an EPA, and also in the creation, distribution, marking or any other activity connected with tests and assessments, resources or services used within the EPA.\nExplicitly included in scope for this policy are all employees, contractors, agency or associate staff, verifiers/examiners and other support roles involved in making judgments in relation to the EPA outcome\n1. Purpose\n1.1 EPAs are required to be conducted impartially with clear delineation between those teaching on the apprenticeship and those carrying out the EPA.\n1.2 This regulation outlines how the University manages and mitigates perceived or actual conflict of interest in the delivery of EPA\n2. Key Principles\n2.1 A conflict of interest arises when an individual, or the University of Nottingham ,UK campus (UNUK) as a whole (including individuals or organisations contracted to deliver EPA on behalf of UNUK) has competing interests which could compromise, or appear to compromise, the outcome of an End Point Assessment.\n2.2 Examples of actual or perceived conflicts of interest include (but are not confined to)\ni.   is currently involved in delivery of the apprenticeship programme and/or on-programme assessment for the standard for which the University is acting as EPAO or has previously been involved in apprenticeship programm e delivery and/or programme assessment for the standard unless all students taught or assessed by the individual have completed their programme.\nii.   has a position of authority in one organisation that conflicts with their interests in another organisation.\niii.   has a prior link with the apprentice, or a link with their employer over the preceding five-year period (including having friends or relatives working with the apprentice or involved in programme delivery).\niv.   has friends, relatives or colleagues taking the apprenticeship programme to which the EPA is aligned.\nv.   has personal interests, paid or unpaid, in the employer organisation undergoing the EPA.\nvi.   has any other interest(s) that may compromise their assessment decisions.\nvii.   has links to or works (paid or unpaid) for the same organisation as the apprentice.\nviii.   stands to derive personal or business gain from the outcome of the assessment; or is working for an organisation in direct competition with the apprentice’s employer.\n2.3 As an End Point Assessment Organisation, the University will ensure:\ni. That delivery of  End-point assessment (EPA) is  in accordance with the apprenticeship standard(programme) specific EPA plan.  The Programme delivery team will be clearly separated from the decision on whether the apprentice has passed their EPA and the final grade they are awarded.\nii.  That anyone involved in the EPA process is free from any conflicts of interest that could adversely affect their judgement or objectivity in administering and undertaking robust and consistent EPA (in line with the requirements set out in the Assessment Plan for the Apprenticeship Standard).\niii.   That the recruitment process for those involved in EPA clearly set out the individual’s obligation to declare any actual or perceived conflict of interest.\niv.   That any involvement in the advice, support or training of the apprentice or apprenticeship programmes provided by the University does not conflict with the independence of the EPA process.\nv.   Processes for the conduct of EPA and the identification and management of actual or perceived conflicts of interest are reviewed at least annually.\nvi.   EPA assessment materials are treated as confidential and kept secure by those involved in the creation, administration and implementation of the EPA process, who must be independent of the apprentice.\nvii.   That there is no collusion with employers, apprentices, other EPAOs, or those providing the apprenticeship programme, in the delivery of the EPA. This includes offering or accepting any incentives or inducements in relation to the delivery of EPA.\n2.4 Programme Directors or nominee are responsible for the early identification of, and planning for, conflict of interest as part of their responsibilities and the planning for every individual EPA.\n2.5 Where an EPA is to be hosted at the employer or provider organisation premises, the Programme Directors or nominee must, as part of the planning process, review any conflict of interest risks and, where identified, set out the actions required to avoid potential conflicts of interest in the EPA plan. Any alternative venue will need prior approval to be designated as a an official examination venue.\n2.6 Individuals are expected to notify their Programme Director  of nominee of any new conflicts of interest as they arise, to be recorded and managed in line with this regulation .\n2.7 Concerns relating to actual or perceived conflicts of interest can be raised with Programme Directors, or nominee (Public Interest Disclosure) Code (see section 3 below).\n2.8 Records of action in response to actual or perceived conflicts of interest will be retained in accordance with the University’s Document Retention Schedule.\nUniversity of Nottingham Document Retention Schedule\n2.9 Independent Assessors\nIncludes:\nEmployer, apprentice, integrated End-Point Assessment\n2.9.1 Overview\nConflict of interest is a key consideration in the appointment of Independent Assessors (IAs). The relationship between the assessor, the employer, the apprentice and the University will be considered within the appointment process as detailed in the guidance available for the recruitment of Independent and External Assessors. All IAs are required to declare conflicts of interest at the time of application to the University. Once appointed, IAs will be given names of the apprentices they are expected to assess for them to review and declare any conflict of interests. Upon reappointment the Independent Assessor will be required to declare if there has been any change of circumstances that may have bearing on their reappointment.\n2.9.2 Restrictions and potential conflicts of interest\nAnyone who is included in the following categories or circumstances may not be appointed:\ni. a member of a governing body or committee of the appointing institution or one of its collaborative partners, or a current employee of the appointing institution; in an exceptional circumstance, an internal assessor may be employed by the University but must not have any interaction with the apprentice in this instance it would require Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) Approval\nii.   anyone with a close professional, contractual or personal relationship with a member of staff or apprentice involved with the programme of study or close connections to the employer\niii.   anyone required to assess colleagues who are recruited as apprentices to the programme of study\niv.   anyone who is, or knows they will be, in a position to significantly influence the future of apprentices on the programme of study\nv.   anyone who is, or has been, significantly involved in current substantive collaborative research activities with a member of staff closely involved in the delivery, management or assessment of the programme(s) in question within the last three years\nvi.   former staff or apprentices of the institution unless a period of five years has elapsed, and all apprentices taught by or with the independent assessor have completed their programme(s)\nvii.   where a reciprocal arrangement involving cognate programmes at another institution is proposed, these cases will be referred to QSC for consideration\nviii.   the succession of an IA by a colleague from the assessor’s home department and institution or organisation\nix.   the appointment of more than one IA from the same department of the same institution or organisation.\n2.10 External Assessors\nIncludes:\nEmployer, apprentice, integrated End-Point Assessment\n2.10.1 Overview\nConflict of interest is a key consideration in the appointment of External Assessors (EAs). The relationship between the assessor, the employer, the apprentice and the University will be considered within the appointment process as detailed as detailed in the guidance available for the recruitment of Independent and External Assessors and managed by Registry and Academic Affairs. All EAs are required to declare conflicts of interest at the time of application to the University. Once appointed, EAs will be given names of the apprentices they are expected to assess for them to review and declare any conflict of interests.  Upon reappointment the External Assessor will be required to advise if there are been any change of circumstances that may have bearing on their appointment.\n2.10.2 Restrictions and potential conflicts of interest\nAnyone who is included in the following categories or circumstances may not be appointed:\ni.   a member of a governing body or committee of the appointing institution or one of its collaborative partners, or a current employee of the appointing institution\nii.   anyone with a close professional, contractual or personal relationship with a member of staff or apprentice involved with the programme of study close connections to the employer\niii.   anyone required to assess colleagues who are recruited as apprentices to the programme of study\niv.   anyone who is, or knows they will be, in a position to significantly influence the future of apprentices on the programme of study\nv.   anyone who is, or has been, significantly involved in current substantive collaborative research activities with a member of staff closely involved in the delivery, management or assessment of the programme(s) in question within the last three years\nvi.   former staff or apprentices of the institution unless a period of five years has elapsed, and all apprentices taught by or with the external assessor have completed their programme(s)\nvii.   where a reciprocal arrangement involving cognate programmes at another institution is proposed, these cases will be referred to QSC for consideration\nviii.   the succession of an EA by a colleague from the assessor’s home department and institution and/or organisation\nix.   the appointment of more than one EA from the same department of the same organisation/institution.\n3.

The Persons with Disabilities Act Malaysia 2018 aims to ensure all students based at the Malaysia have equal access to educational opportunities.  The Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Protection of Disabled Persons 2018 ensures the right to equal access to educational to disabled persons.  The Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) Quality Code for Higher Education also makes reference to access to an inclusive environment for learning and aims to ensure that all students have equal access to educational opportunities.\n2.2 Overview of the University's commitment\nThe University is strongly committed to equality of opportunity in its provision for all students, providing ongoing support with the focus being on providing accessible services and supporting students in completing their courses as independently as possible.\nAs part of this commitment, the University believes that teaching rooms are to be allocated and timetabled with the needs of disabled students in mind, including additional space for wheelchair users and scribes. This includes taking account of physical access to buildings/rooms, the surrounding environment (for example, parking provision) and facilities in the teaching rooms themselves.\n3.0 Roles and Responsibilities\nStudents are responsible to contact Disability Support Services to arrange an assessment.\nSchools are responsible to refer any student with a timetabling issue directly to Disability Support Services as a matter of urgency.\nDisability Support Services are responsible for assessing the student and liaising with the Timetabling team.\n4.0 Procedure for alternative timetable arrangements for disabled students\nThe procedure for making alternative timetable arrangements for disabled students is as follows:\nAll students requiring alternative arrangements of any nature must be assessed by Disability Support Services.\nSchool staff must refer any disabled student with a timetabling issue directly to Disability Support Services as a matter of urgency as the further the timetabling build progresses, the more constrained the scheduling is and the more difficult it is to find timetabling solutions.\nDisability Support Services will assess student needs and pass recommendations for timetabling arrangements to the Timetabling Office where rooms will be allocated/reallocated accordingly.\n5.0 Related Regulations, Policies and Procedures\nFor more information about the services provided by Disability Support Services, please consult the following:\nUNUK Disability support services\nUNM Disability Services\nUNNC Disability support service\nModule registration (for new and returning students) information can be found at:\nUNUK Module enrolment\nUNM Course enrolment\nUNNC Academic services\nAdditional links:\nExamination arrangements for disabled students\n6.0 Version Control Table\nVersion Control Table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nReformatted to align with new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework based on content last modified on 06/08/2024\nQSC\nFebruary 2025\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n24 February 2025||"

Its content is directed at staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.1.0 Purpose\nThis page applies to all disabled students with a Support Plan created by the Disability Support Services. These guidelines set out the arrangements for organising the effective assessment of disabled students.\n2.0 Key Principles\n2.1 Overview\nAs part of its commitment to disabled students, the University believes that assessment methods will be appropriate to academic objectives of the course and minimise any impact of a student’s condition on performance in assessment.  This means that some students may require alternative arrangements (‘accommodations’) for examinations or other assessments.  For some students these will be described in their Support Plans.  Students without Disability Support Plans can also discuss accessibility with their tutors.\nThe University aligns with the Quality Assurance Agency's Quality Code for Higher Education. In particular the University is attentive to the following Principle: “Provides design assessments that test learning outcomes and are fair, reliable, accessible, authentic and inclusive. Where applicable, and sustainable, students are offered different options for undertaking assessments to promote accessibility and inclusion”. At the same time, the rigour and comparability of the assessment must be protected with the effect that one academic standard is applied to all students.\nWherever possible, disabled students must undertake the same assessments as others on their course.\n2.2 Determination of alternative assessment arrangements for formal examinations\nSpecific provision may be necessary for students with Disability Support Plans for formal examinations. Some examples of adjustments can be found in the  'Related Regulation, Policies and Procedures' section below, where you will also find marking guidelines for students using exam stickers.\n2.3 Determination of alternative assessment arrangements for coursework and other assessments\nStudents must not be required to make a disclosure of their name on cover sheets for coursework in order to allow them the same opportunities for anonymity that are available to other students. However, where there are requests for alternative forms of assessment or for extensions to deadlines, relevant staff may have to be informed of the accommodation.\nThe University recognises that the production of written work may present particular challenges for some disabled students and has made provision for additional specialist support for these students. Therefore, the coursework of students with a Disability Support Plan is marked following the same criteria as that applied to all students. Students with a Disability Support Plan can request that Schools clarify their marking criteria so that they are aware of any penalties imposed for inaccurate spelling or poor presentation.\nExtensions to deadlines are deemed ‘a reasonable adjustment’ and will be one of the recommendations made by Disability Support Services in the Disability Support Plan shared with Disability Liaison Officers (DLOs) and other relevant colleagues, which students must request (using the correct process - see below) in order to access the extension.\nIt is also possible that a small number of disabled students may require an alternative form of assessment for coursework and examinations on occasion.\n3.0 Roles and Responsibilities\nThe University will ensure that policies and procedures for requesting accommodations to assessment and examinations are widely publicised and easy for students to follow and will endeavour to apply them consistently across the institution. It is the University's responsibility to give students opportunities to disclose their disability and to ensure appropriate confidentiality. Students must be aware, however, that in order for alternative arrangements to be implemented, relevant staff will need to be informed of the disclosure. The main mechanism by which disabled students receive specific accommodations is through the issuance of a Disability Support Plan\nIt is the student's responsibility to ensure that the University is aware of their disability and to apply for any accommodations in assessment conditions within deadlines which are established for this purpose. Any request must be supported by appropriate evidence. The links for how to submit evidence in relation to your request can be found in the 'Related Regulation, Policies and Procedures' section below\nIt is also the responsibility of the student to request an extension to a coursework deadline\nDisability Support Services are responsible for recommending reasonable adjustments after consultation where appropriate with relevant University staff or bodies.\nStudent services are responsible for implementing alternative arrangements for students (as outlined in their Disability Support Plan) for examinations controlled centrally.\nSchools are responsible for implementing alternative arrangements for students (as outlined in their Disability Support Plan) for examinations which are held by Schools independently or where it involves another form of assessment.\n4.0 Procedural Steps for Students\nAlternative arrangements for formal examinations can be made in discussion with Disability Support Services who liaise with the central exam team and assessment teams.\nStudents requesting a deadline extension must complete and submit the Coursework Extension Request Form (CERF) (available in the ‘Related Regulations, Policies and Procedures’ section below).\nIf a disabled student requires an alternative form of assessment for coursework and/or examinations, there will be consultation between the School, the student and Disability Support Services to discuss and agree options that align with both the learning objectives and reasonable adjustments.\nInformation for students who wish to request alternative arrangements for assessments is available on the Alternative Exam Arrangements website, the link for which can be found in the ‘Related Regulations, Policies and Procedures’ section below.\n5.0 Related Regulations, Policies and Procedures\nFor more information about examples of adjustments possible for exams, please consult the following\nAlternative Exam Arrangements (UNUK)\nAlternative Exam Arrangements (UNM)\nAlternative Exam Arrangements (UNNC)\nFor more information for students with support plans about how to request a course extension, please consult the following:\nStudents with Disability Support Plans - access to coursework extensions\nPolicy on long-term conditions or disabilities affecting students' ability to study and complete assessment\nFor more information about how to submit your evidence, which is required before recommendations can be made for alternative arrangements in assessments, please consult the following:\nSubmitting your evidence (UNUK)\nSubmitting your evidence (UNM)\nSubmitting your evidence (UNNC)\nFor more information about the Disability Support Services provided, please consult the following:\nUNUK Disability support services\nUNM Disability Services\nUNNC Disability support service\nFor more information about alternative timetabling arrangements, please consult the following:\nTeaching timetable arrangements for disabled students\n6.0 Version Control Table\nVersion Control Table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nReformatted to align with new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework based on content last modified on 06/08/2024\nQSC\nFebruary 2025\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n24 February 2025||"

Its content is applicable to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses and covers both students assessed work and materials that support the assessment process e.g. assessment briefings, marks schemes, etc.Scope\nThese regulations relate to all assessment types both online and paper based. Where assessment results in a physical artifact, Schools are not required to retain the physical object but must consider retaining photographic or video evidence of the students work.\nSchools should maintain and use sample marked scripts in all subject areas to ensure maintenance of academic standards.\n1. Purpose\nThe University must retain appropriate evidence of students assessed work together with appropriate supporting materials i.e. assessment briefs, examination question papers, marking criteria, mark schemes, model answers, submission deadlines, etc for a specified period in order to meet academic, statutory and regulatory requirement and legal obligations.\nThe regulations and procedures for the retention and disposal of assessment material form part of a wider Document Retention Schedule, which is prepared in accordance with the University’s Record Management Policy.\n2. Key Principles\nSchools in liaison with Learning Technologies should  retain appropriate records of students accessed work together with contextual documentation that inform the assessment process.  The documents retained must allow for judgments on rigour of assessment to be made to draw reliable conclusions about the entirely of the provision in relation to the University’s compliance with the Office for Students conditions of registration B4 and B5. Retained documentation will also be used to support the External Examiner process and where appropriate provide information to support the complaint and appeal process.\nAppropriate records  should be retained for the periods as set out in the University’s records retention schedule and must facilitate judgement about the effective assessment and credibility of the awards conferred by the University.\nAll assessed work that is retained in accordance with the University’s records management policy.\nRecords Management (internal only)\nThe disposal of student work must only be done on the authority of the relevant Department, and in compliance with the University’s Data Retention policy.\nWhere submitted work is coursework and this has been returned to the student for the purposes of providing feedback, Schools should ensure that either a copy has been retained within the School or that on request work can be returned to the School at a later date. Any work retained should be kept until at least the end of the academic session following the session in which the assessment occurred. Where assessments are submitted electronically Schools may wish to consult the Learning Technologies team to ascertain whether the chosen submission method fulfils the assessment and administrative requirements.\nIf you have a problem or query for the Learning Technologies team, please email:\nlearning-technologies@nottingham.ac.uk\nPast marks should be used to analyse trends in results in order to evaluate the maintenance and development of academic standards. If your School uses Campus for marks processing, comparative statistics can be produced from this system. Please contact Student Services (Assessment Team) for further details.\n3.

Its content is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Overview\nStudents would expect to spend 10 hours learning on average to gain one academic credit, including scheduled teaching and directed learning activities and private study time. This guidance refers to scheduled teaching and directed learning activity which includes synchronous teaching and learning and directed asynchronous learning activities completed onsite or remotely.\nImplementation\nIncludes:\nprovision dates\nThe provisions which are outlined on this page were first introduced as follows and have been applied from the start of the following academic sessions:\n2012/13 Students on the Foundation Stage and Qualifying Stage of Honours Degree and Integrated Masters programmes\n2013/14 Students on Part I of Honours Degree and Integrated Masters programmes\n2014/15 Students on Part II of Honours Degree and Integrated Masters programmes and students on Part III of Integrated Masters programmes.\n2021/22 Students on post graduate taught programmes\nDefining teaching and learning activities\nScheduled teaching and directed learning activities include digital learning, delivered onsite or remotely and in-person teaching. Activities may be synchronous or directed asynchronous and include for example:\nDemonstrations\nExternal visits\nFieldwork and placements\nLectures\nPractical classes and workshops (including labs and clinical skills)\nProject supervision\nSeminars\nSupervised time in studio/workshop\nTutorials\nWork-based learning\nMinimum levels of scheduled teaching and directed learning activity\nIncludes:\ntypical hours; School requirements; expectations for a full-time programme\nThe levels below relate to a student following a typical programme of study (based upon modules comprising 120 credits per year and there being 22 teaching weeks in the year) and provide the minimum number of scheduled learning hours per 10 credits:\n22 hours for students taking the Foundation Stage or Qualifying Stage of Honours Degree and Integrated Masters programmes\n18 hours for students taking Part I of Honours Degree or Integrated Masters programmes\n15 hours for students on Part II of Honours Degree or Integrated Masters programmes and for students taking Part III of Integrated Masters programmes.\nFor a student on a post graduate taught course (based on modules comprising 180 credits per year and there being 22 teaching weeks per year) the minimum number of teaching hours per 10 credits is 7 hours.\nStudy hours on placement modules may be counted towards the above totals.\nThese are typical pathways. Any Schools which do not provide a typical pathway are still expected to aim for these levels as far as possible. This will not be directly applicable to UoN apprenticeship programmes where work-based learners have non-standard timetabling through each year of study (please refer to specific programme provision).\nPGT supervision expectations\nEvery taught postgraduate student completing a full Master's qualification (whether full or part time, on a professional course, or on a distance learning course) must be allocated a Master's project supervisor and must be informed of who this is prior to the start of substantive work on the Master's project. The assignment of a supervisor to each student will be the responsibility of the appropriate personnel within each School. If the allocated supervisor cannot fulfil their duties for unforeseen circumstances (e.g. illness), the School will allocate a replacement supervisor and notify the student of the change in a timely manner.\nRegulation around Master's project supervision provides that;\nSchools will ensure that supervisors at least meet the minimum number of meetings and contacts described in the PGT supervision guidance document. It is also recommended that Schools ensure similar experiences for students by stipulating a maximum number of meetings and contacts and setting the date when supervision of the project will end.\nThe same minimum and maximum numbers of supervisory meetings apply to all students regardless of visa status.  However, where the student is in the UK on a student visa they need to consider the timing of their supervision meetings as where there is no simultaneous teaching activity (normally June – August inclusive) the student must have a monthly PGT supervision meeting during this period in line with the UKVI guidance for staff (link provided below), whereas these would be optional for students not on a student visa.\nIt will be the supervisor’s responsibility to initiate the introductory contact. Providing the student has been advised of who their supervisor is, it is the student’s responsibility to initiate any subsequent contacts required thereafter. Students that fail to respond or maintain contact with their supervisor do so at their own choosing for which the School will not be held responsible. Student visa holders who fail to respond or maintain contact with their supervisor will risk immigration compliance implications in accordance with the terms of their student visa.\nSupervisors will offer the opportunity to receive feedback if deemed necessary by the student, on the progress of the project prior to submission. Schools are to determine the level of feedback offered and to advise students accordingly e.g. one review of a chapter or a % of the document. If feedback is required, the work should be submitted in the agreed manner by the agreed deadline.\nSchools will ensure that additional support provisions are highlighted to their students (examples can be found in the PGT Supervision guidance) for students to access independently.\nFor more information about PGT supervision please consult the PGT supervision guidance document:\nPGT supervision guidance document\nFor more information about UKVI PGT supervision guidance, please consult the UKVI PGT supervision guidance document\nPGT masters project visa guidance document\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n03 July 2024||"

They are also referred to as the ‘Here for You’ Academic Guides. This page describes the recruitment, roles and responsibilities of the Academic Guides.\n2.0 Role and Responsibilities\nThe University Senior Tutor will be responsible for regularly reviewing and updating these regulations, policies, and procedures to ensure alignment with the Quality Manual, and the University's overall student support framework and best practices.\nThe Academic Guides will maintain accurate records of student interactions, student attendance  at meetings with the Academic Guide, and any interventions provided. The lead School/Unit must allocate every undergraduate student an Academic Guide at the start of their course.\nThe lead School/Unit must appoint Joint Honours students an Academic Guide from that School/Unit. In the non-lead school, the student will be appointed a Joint Honours Liaison Officer or an Academic Guide.\n2.1 Workload and Allocation\nThe School/Unit will allocate appropriate workload in the Academic Guide's workload plan to ensure sufficient time for duties. Typically, the workload amounts to 0.2 FTE,  encompassing responsibilities for overseeing typically 80-100 students.\n2.2 Professional Development\nThe School/Unit will signpost Academic Guides to ongoing professional development provided by the University in relation to student support, advising, coaching methodologies, and EDI best practices, and encourage Academic Guides to take up these training opportunities.\nThe School/Unit will ensure Academic Guides receive regular updates on changes to university policies, procedures, and support services.\n2.3 Boundaries and Limitations\nThe Academic Guide will not be involved in organising timetables, participating in EC panels, or, for UNUK students, engagement in dashboard monitoring.\n2.4 Inclusion and Diversity\nThe School/Unit will ensure Academic Guides adhere to the University's EDI principles and are aware of the Access and Participation Plan, promoting inclusivity and understanding among students.\nThe School/Unit will require Academic Guides to demonstrate sensitivity to cultural issues and to be able to communicate effectively with individuals from diverse backgrounds.\n2.5 Communication and Transparency\nThe School/Unit will clearly and timely communicate the role, responsibilities, and boundaries of the Academic Guide to all undergraduate students, including incoming students and exchange students.\nThe School/Unit will ensure any changes or updates to the Academic Guide role are promptly communicated to all undergraduate students.\nThe School/Unit will establish clear channels for students to provide feedback or raise concerns regarding the Academic Guide system.\n2.6 Conflict Resolution and Complaint Procedures\nThe School/Unit will have clear protocols for addressing conflicts or complaints that may arise between Academic Guides and students or other parties.\nThe School/Unit will define the appropriate channels for escalating and resolving such issues within the School/Unit or at the University level.\nThe School/Unit will, where appropriate, permit a student to change their Academic Guide and will clearly advertise this process to students.\n2.7 Support, Performance Evaluation and Continuous Improvement\nThe School/Unit will use an agreed framework for regularly evaluating the performance of Academic Guides, beyond relying solely on student feedback.\nThe School/Unit will establish mechanisms for identifying areas of improvement, providing constructive feedback, and implementing necessary support or training for Academic Guides.\nThe School/Unit will signpost Academic Guides to ongoing support and wellbeing provision provided by the University and encourage Academic Guides to take up these opportunities.\n2.8 Succession Planning and Continuity\nThe School/Unit will have, where possible, procedures for ensuring a smooth transition and continuity of support when Academic Guides leave their roles or new ones are appointed.\nThe School/Unit will have measures to maintain institutional knowledge and ensure a consistent student experience during such transitions.\n2.9 Accessibility and Reasonable Accommodations\nThe School/Unit will implement guidelines for ensuring that the services provided by Academic Guides are accessible to students with disabilities or specific requirements.\nThe School/Unit will outline procedures for providing reasonable accommodations within the ‘Here for You’ scheme and collaborating with disability support services when necessary.\n3.10 Contingency Planning:The School/Unit will develop contingency plans to address situations where Academic Guides may be unavailable or unable to fulfil their duties, such as instances of illness or emergencies.\nThe School/Unit will establish protocols for ensuring continuity of support and communication with students in such cases.\n3.0 Procedural Steps\n3.1 Recruitment and Selection\nThe School/Unit will use the University-agreed job description and person specification for the Academic Guide role, without adding or subtracting from the requirements outlined.\nThe School/Unit will monitor the performance of Academic Guides in relation to the job description and person specification.\nThe School/Unit will implement a fair and transparent recruitment process.\nThe School/Unit will ensure successful candidates undergo training in Safeguarding, Prevent, GDPR compliance, CMA, and EDI principles, before commencing their duties.  This is a minimum and not an exhaustive list of development that may be useful in the role.\nAcademic Guides must be academic/clinical academic members of staff. Note that in the UK, clinical lecturers, practitioner health lecturers, NHS mentors, and social work practice learning tutors or equivalent can be Academic Guides.\n3.2 Meetings and Support\nThe School/Unit will provide guidelines for Academic Guides to conduct group meetings (which will take place four times a year) and/or to make arrangements for individual drop-ins.\nThe School/Unit will determine agendas prior to group meetings and disseminate to students sufficiently in advance to allow for adequate preparation.\nThe School/Unit will establish procedures for students to book one-on-one meetings with Academic Guides either in-person or online.\nAcademic Guides will have regular meetings and collaboration with key support teams (e.g., student wellbeing, learning development, EDI, disability support).\nAcademic Guides will be in regular contact with the other members of the School/Unit's 'Here for You' team.\n3.3 Record-keeping and Reporting\nAcademic Guides will use advisory notes on Campus for recording student attendance and interactions.\nThe School/Unit will establish procedures for Academic Guides to report non-attendance to the responsible party within the School/Unit.\nAcademic Guides will maintain confidentiality and adhere to data protection regulations.\n3.4 Evaluation and Feedback\nThe School/Unit will conduct annual surveys to gather student feedback on the effectiveness of the Academic Guide system and support provided.\nThe School/Unit will implement processes for analysing survey results, identifying areas for improvement, and implementing necessary actions.\nThe School/Unit will ensure that learning from survey results is shared with other Schools/Units\nThe School/Unit will establish clear communication channels for disseminating survey findings, and associated actions to students.\n4.0 Related Regulations, Policies and Procedures\nThe scope of student support, development and personal tutoring\nInduction and tutoring statements\nPersonal tutoring\nRole and responsibilities of Senior Tutors\nDisabled students\nHigh Performance Athlete academic flexibility\n5.0 Version Control Table\nVersion Control Table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nPage published\nQSC\nJune 2024\n1.1\nReformatted to align with new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework based on content last modified on 8/1/25\nQSC\nFebruary 2025\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n24 February 2025||"

        "content": "High Performance Athlete academic flexibility - The University of NottinghamHigh Performance Athlete academic flexibility\nThis page contains the University's stance on academic flexibility in respect of High Performance Athletes (HPAs). This information is only relevant to staff and students based at the UK campus.1.0 Overview\nThis summary has been developed to enable dual-career support for highly talented sporting individuals persue their studies whilst competing at a high level in their sport.\nThe University of Nottingham Sports’ Scholarship and Recruitment Manager (SRM) will identify High Performance Athletes (HPAs).\nStudents on the Sports Scholarship Programme (SSP) and/or on the Talented Athlete Scholarship Scheme (TASS) would automatically qualify as an HPA and thus be eligible to receive support. Not all HPAs at the University of Nottingham will be on the SSP or TASS.\nAt the start of each Academic year, the SRM will share a list HPAs with the Faculty Associate Pro-Vice Chancellors for Education and Student Experience (FAPVCs for ESE) (or their nominated deputy) for approval. These HPAs would then be eligible for the support outlined in this document as applicable.\nThe approved list will be shared by the SRM with the Faculty HPA Leads to distribute to appropriate HPA tutors and teaching staff for each Faculty, and the Director of Registry and Academic Affairs (or their delegate) to distribute to the approprate process senior managers. For avoidance of doubt, HPA Tutors are additional to the student's usual Personal Tutor and are special tutors especially for HPAs who act as a key liaison for the student with their course teams. These academic staff would be identified by the FAPVC for ESE (or nominated deputy) and training provided, as necessary, by the SRM and their team.\nThe SRM will meet all identified HPAs at the beginning of the academic year to outline the academic support available. These HPAs are then expected to identify and organise a meeting with their HPA Tutor and, if appropriate (for instance, for HPAs who are also SSP and TASS athletes) jointly with their Performance Lifestyle Advisor (PLA), where a range of support will be discussed and identified between them and to review the academic and sporting schedules for the year. This support will be reviewed periodically throughout the academic year where needed, depending on the training and competition schedule of the HPA.\nSupport to HPAs will be provided in the ways detailed below.\n2.0 Information for student visa holders\nStaff and students referring to this guidance where the student is a student visa holder must note:\nThere are specific limitations on sporting activity on a student visa as detailed in paragraph 6.14 – 6.19 of the student sponsor guidance (sponsorship duties).\nUK Visas and Immigration Student sponsor guidance\nThe University UKVI academic engagement monitoring requirements apply at all times to all student visa holders. The statutory expectation is that the academic attendance of student visa holders will be prioritised. For the avoidance of doubt, this means that all students, including HPAs, must be regularly and consistently attending and engaging with their course.\nSpecific cases must be referred to the University’s Visa and Immigration team, where any doubt arises which might affect the student or the University from an immigration compliance perspective.\n3.0 Academic support\nIncludes:\nExtenuating circumstances, alternative methods of assessment\nAcademic departments' primary support for students may be through the Extenuating Circumstances (EC) policy. Where an HPA’s sitting of an assessment is disrupted by sporting commitments, the EC Panel has discretion to award any relevant EC outcome. EC Panels are encouraged to be flexible.\nThis is in line with the University's Extenuating Circumstances policy. For more information, please consult the following:\nStudent Services - Extenuating Circumstances Procedure\nThe meaning of “Representing the University at a national event or involvement in some other significant/prestigious event” includes a training or competition event deemed as key to their elite pathway. This will be confirmed by the University of Nottingham Sports’ Scholarship and Recruitment Manager (SRM) whose written statement would be considered sufficient evidence.\nFor more information about acceptable circumstances, please consult the following:\nGuidance on Acceptable Circumstances and Evidence (EC Procedure)\n3.1 Extenuating Circumstances for group work/projects.\nEC requests which involve summative group work will be addressed on a case by case basis given the different nature of group work.\nIt may be possible to offer an alternative mode for the HPA and/or a different submission date, although the decision making must include the potential impact to others within their group.\nThe SRM, HPA Tutor and Module Convenor (liaising with Exams Officer as necessary) will work together to do their best to develop a workable solution.\n3.2 Alternative methods of assessment.\nIn certain cases it may be necessary to explore alternative modes of assessment. Such cases would need to be discussed between SRM, HPA Tutor, Module Convenor, Exams Officer of the relevant academic department, and EC panel, and approved on a case by case basis.\nThis is in line with the University's Extenuating Circumstances policy. For more information, please consult the following:\nStudent Services - Extenuating Circumstances Procedure\nA possible recommendation from an EC panel is an alternative form of assessment “Recommend a different form of re-assessment, as determined by the School, if the same or equivalent of the original is no longer possible, to assess whether the learning outcomes are achieved. Students have no automatic right to individual assessment of this nature.” For more information, please consult the following:\nStudent Services - Guidance on Recommendations for EC Panels\nIt is noted that usually Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) approval would be needed if this alternative form of assessment was outside regulation. This QSC case would need to be prepared and approved (involving relevant school staff), to confirm that learning outcomes would be met and grounds for it are met, and this would be undertaken by the HPA Tutor.\n4.0 Exams overseas\nIncludes:\nlocation of exams; administration charges\n4.1 Location of Exams\nAt times it is recognised that in exceptional circumstances a HPA may need to take an exam abroad if no other option is possible for them to complete the exam. An alternative may be to take the exam in the UK on the next assessment date.\nThe Overseas Examinations Arrangements policy already exists. For more information, please consult the following:\nServices for Students - How to apply for an overseas examination\nA match/event overseas at the time of the exams, qualifies as a reason to take the exam overseas in accordance with the established policy. This could equally be a key training camp as much as a competitive event. The importance of the event (and whether it qualifies as a reason) will be confirmed by the SRM, whose written statement would be considered sufficient evidence.\nHPAs should be aware that travel within country may be required in order to access an approved centre to sit exams overseas.\nThe HPA will need to apply by the Exams Office Overseas published deadlines, which are usually approximately 3 months before the start of an exam period. No extension on this is afforded by this policy.\nIf change is needed at short notice, it is likely that an alternative assessment date will be required. This would be achieved using the Extenuating Circumstances policy.\n4.2 Administration charge.\nThe University has an administration charge for students taking exams as part of an Overseas Examinations Arrangement. It is requested that HPAs have this fee waived.\nAny fee would be paid for the HPA under the Performance Sport budget where possible within the Department of Sport (approval through Assistant Director of Sport – Performance).\nNote, there may also be local fees to pay applied by the host venue where the exam is to take place, which would be for the HPAs’ or their National governing body to meet.\nThe SRM and HPA Tutor would support the HPA in identifying a suitable local venue.\nOften, either due to short notice or the focus required for the event, it may be more suitable to apply under the Extenuating Circumstances policy to sit the exam on a later date.\n5.0 Timetable\nIncludes:\nadjustments to personal timetable; practical assessments; flexibility; group work; academic year splitting\n5.1 Adjustments to personal timetable\nWhere possible and with enough notice, a HPA may be allowed to change seminar groups for the academic year. The SRM, HPA Tutor and Module Convenor in collaboration with timetabling will work together to develop a viable solution.\n5.2 Timetable adjustment for practical assessments.\nWhere an HPA is unable to attend a test, lab or practical formative assessment, then the Extenuating Circumstances policy does not apply.\nIn these circumstances, the SRM and/or HPA Tutor will liaise with the Module Convenor to see if the HPA is able to attend an alternative session.\nIf no alternative sessions are available, the SRM, HPA Tutor and Module Convenor will work together to do their best to develop a different solution, but if this is not possible it is understood that an HPA may need to attend the original formative assessment/practical.\n5.3 Explore flexible or revised placement dates/times/locations.\nThough it is respected that placements can be a challenge to alter, where foresight is possible and flexibility available, the SRM, HPA Tutor and Module Convenor (or whoever most appropriate school person is) will do their best to ensure an HPA receives placements that allow the HPA to continue their training and competition through being provided with placements in closer proximity to Nottingham and/or are understanding of HPA’s situations.\n5.4 Splitting academic years.\nIn particular circumstances and if possible an HPA may be granted the ability to split an academic year into two within regulations relating to maximum number of credits per semester\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nTaught module enrolment and registering for additional credits\nThis is currently only possible for home fee status HPAs (due to student visa limitations meaning that the University will not act as the immigration sponsor for a student to undertake part time study).\nThis will be arranged by the HPA. If part time (PT) study is within regulations for the programme, a transfer form can be submitted. If part time study is outside of regulations, and where PT study is possible then with the Personal Tutor and Course Leader’s agreement a case to Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) can be submitted for consideration and approval.\n6.0 Attendance and engagement\nIncludes:\nauthorised absence recording; 1:1 academic support\n6.1 Authorised absence recording\nSome academic departments request mandatory attendance and engagement from a student. Due to sporting commitments a HPA may need to receive a authorised absence, which does not count against their mandatory attendance record.\nIt is important to note that an exception to any flexibility with attendance applies where the student is in the UK on a student visa. Wherever the University acts as the student’s immigration sponsor in the UK, the student is expected to regularly and consistently attend and engage with their studies, prioritising academic studies and engagement over sporting activity and/or work, as required by their visa\nAttendance monitoring requirements are managed at a local level. Please refer to the University attendance and engagement policy which can be found here:\nRegulations governing attendance and engagement\n6.2 1:1 Academic support.\nDue to the nature of an HPA having to balance their academic and sporting commitments, this may result in an HPA missing some aspects of their academic studies.\nAll students are allocated a Personal Tutor by their School, as explained in the Personal Tutoring policy (see here).\nPersonal tutors are not expected to be able to advise on all matters of personal and professional development and support. They are, however, expected to have sufficient knowledge of their school and the wider University so that they can help students to find the assistance they require.\nIn addition, it may be the case that if an HPA misses some key aspects of their academic studies, an academic department may agree to support an HPA with a small number of 1:1 academic tutorials, where necessary and possible (for example, staff workload may not permit this).\nThis would be discussed on a case by case basis with the HPA Tutor, Course Lead and relevant Module Convenor.\n7.0 Voluntary interruption of studies\nAt certain times, due to major sporting competitions, a HPA may need to take some time out from their studies. An academic School will allow an HPA to interrupt their studies on these grounds subject to regulations concerning maximum periods of registration.\nThis is in line with the Voluntary Interruption of Studies (VIS) policy.\nThe HPA would apply for VIS in the usual way with support from the HPA tutor.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nVoluntary interruption of study\n8.0 Expectations and responsibilities of High Performance Athletes (HPAs) receiving support\nEnsure initial meetings are held with their respective Performance Lifestyle Advisor (PLA) and HPA Tutor within a month of the start date of their course and appropriate follow-up meetings are also held (particularly for periods where a high degree of flux relating to sporting events is likely to occur).\nTo provide their training and competition schedules at the start of the academic year and/or as soon as possible and to ensure that they keep this updated and advise their PLA and personal tutor accordingly.\nLiaise with coaches to explore the possibility of revising training commitments where possible.\nEnsure their studies remain a priority and are pro-active in seeking support where needed via the University of Nottingham Sports’ Scholarship and Recruitment Manager (SRM) , PLA, or personal tutor/'Here for You' Academic Guide.\nFor HPAs on a student visa, they need to take accountability for ensuring their studies remain a priority where   they are in the UK on a student visa and that they are aware of the limitations of the student visa route for their chosen sporting activities. Student visa holders should also know how to contact the Visa and Immigration team for further advice, support and guidance on immigration matters where applicable\nUpdate their PLA, personal tutor, HPA tutor and SRM with changes to sporting commitments in a timely manner.\n9.0 Other relevant regulations\nPlease note that students in the UK on a Student Route visa are also affected by the University's Policy on Immigration Sponsorship. Where academic policies and immigration policies seem to be contradictory, immigration policies will take precedence. For more information, please consult the following:\nLimitations on immigration sponsorship and Graduate Visa reporting\nFor more information on the University's Extenuating Circumstances policy, please consult the following:\nStudent Services - Extenuating Circumstances Procedure\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n18 June 2024||"

        "content": "Regulations from September 2020 - The University of NottinghamRegulations from September 2020\nThis page contains the University's study regulations for all undergraduate students who entered their qualifying year or Part I* from September 2020. Its content is applicable to undergraduate students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Overview\nIncludes:\nsupplementary and fitness to practice regulations; assessment regulations; extenuating circumstances; contact details\nThese regulations take effect from 2020/21 for students entering Qualifying year or Part I from September 2020. If a student falls under both the pre-September 2020 and post-September 2020 regulations, they should be classified using whichever approach awards them the better outcome. Other students are subject to former regulations except for Regulation 26(b) which applies to all students from September 2020.\nFor more information about the former regulations, please consult the following section:\nUndergraduate study regulations\nSupplementary and Fitness to practise Regulations\nIn addition to the study regulations which are stated on this page, students will be subject to the supplementary regulations for their individual courses, which can be found at:\nCurriculum Catalogue\nIn addition, some programmes will be subject to Fitness to Practise regulations, details of which are included in relevant course handbooks.\nApprenticeship Programmes\nAn individual undertaking an apprenticeship programme at the University of Nottingham (UK campus) will be considered as a part time student. All regulations in the Quality Manual that make reference to ‘students’, also apply to apprentices, unless otherwise stated.\nAssessment Regulations\nAssessment regulations can be found on the following page:\nAssessment and marking policies\nExtenuating circumstances\nGuidance on managing students with extenuating circumstances can be found on the following:\nExtenuating circumstances\nContact details\nStudents seeking advice on these regulations should contact their School/Department.\nSchools can obtain guidance on these regulations by emailing:\nug-regulations@nottingham.ac.uk\n.\nApproved courses of study\nIncludes:\nqualification requirements; module selection; credit limits\n1.\nTo qualify for an award a student must:\n(a)\nPursue an approved course of study as prescribed by a programme specification.\n(b)\nPass the assessments specified in these Regulations and in the relevant programme specification.\n(c)\nSuccessfully complete any additional components that are required as specified in the relevant programme specification.\n2.\nStudents must select their modules in accordance with the relevant programme specification and the University’s Qualifications Framework. This selection should be undertaken in consultation with their academic tutors and shall be subject to the approval of their School. A School offering a module has the right to refuse admission to that module.\nFor more information about the University's Qualification Framework, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\n3.\nIn making their selection of modules, students must satisfy any prerequisites, co-requisites or other requirements set out in the relevant module or programme specification.\n4.\nStudents may not select modules worth more than 70 credits in any one semester.\nAward of credit\nIncludes:\npass mark; components; failure to pass; Recognition of Other Learning (ROL)\n5.\nThe pass mark for a module is 40%. In order to pass a module and be awarded the credit for that module a student must also satisfy any requirements as specified in paragraph 6.\n6.\nThe module specification states how the components of the module will be combined to form a module mark and whether a particular mark must be gained in individual components of the module in order for the module as a whole to be passed.\n7.\nA student who fails to pass a module may nevertheless be awarded the credit for that module in the circumstances set out in Regulations 10 and 11 (within the Completion of a stage section).\n8.\nCredit may also be awarded under the University’s policy on Recognition of Other Learning (ROL)(formerly known as Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL)). For more information, please consult the following:\nRecognition of Other Learning\nCompletion of a stage\nIncludes:\nfailure of one or more modules; progression requirements\n9.\nA student who passes all the modules in a given stage of their course (as defined in the University’s Qualifications Framework) will complete that stage and be awarded the total credit for that stage. A student who completes the requirements for a Foundation Certificate or qualifies for an Honours level or Integrated Masters degree through application of the relevant degree classification model and weightings (see Regulations 22 and 23 of the Classification section) will automatically complete the final stage of their course and be awarded the total credit for that stage, unless the relevant programme specification contains additional requirements for completion of the final stage. For more information about the University's Qualifications Framework, please consult the following page:\nQualification types and structures\n10.\nA student who fails one or more modules will still complete that stage (subject to Regulation 11 below), and so be awarded the total credit for that stage provided that they have:\n(a)\nPassed modules worth at least 80 credits and have a weighted average for the stage of at least 40% with no module marks of less than 30%\nor\n(b)\nPassed modules worth at least 100 credits and have a weighted average for the stage of at least 50%\nor\n(c)\nPassed modules worth at least 90 credits, have marks of 30% or more in modules worth at least 110 credits, and have a weighted average for the stage of at least 45%\n.\n11.\nRegulation 10 does not apply to the final stage of any degree programme nor to any module which is listed in the relevant programme specification as not compensatable. A student who fails a non-compensatable module will not complete that stage without successfully undertaking re-assessment in that module.\n12.\nStudents registered on the following types of programmes may be required by the relevant programme specification to attain higher marks in individual specified modules and/or higher average marks than indicated in paragraphs 9 and 10 above.\n(i)\nAn Integrated Masters programme\n(ii)\nCertain Honours programmes with a compulsory period away from the University.\nStudents in categories (i) and (ii) above who fail to satisfy the requirements of such a programme but who nonetheless satisfy the criteria as stated in Regulations 9 or 10 will be eligible to transfer to an alternative course, where one exists, as stated in the Supplementary Regulations.\n(iii)\nThe Foundation Stage of any programme\nStudents in category (iii) above who fail to meet the specified requirement may be unable to progress but subject to satisfying Regulation 9 above will be awarded the Foundation Certificate.\nReassessment\nIncludes:\nstudent rights; potential scenarios; progression requirements and options\n13.\nA student who, at the first attempt, has not satisfactorily completed a stage other than the final stage under Regulations 9-11 (of the Completion of a stage section above) has a right to one re-assessment in each failed module where this might enable a student to satisfy progression requirements. The form of the re-assessment will be the same as for the first attempt unless stated otherwise in the module specification. Reassessment marks are considered only in decisions relating to progression to the next stage hence reassessments in the final stage of any programme are not relevant or allowed except in the case of reassessment for a Pass or Ordinary degree or where a student has failed a non-compensatable module, or a compulsory module for an apprenticeship programme, and is required to take a reassessment in order to gain the credits and complete the stage.\n14.\nWhere a student has pass marks in one or more components of the module, but has failed the module overall, the School delivering the module will limit the re-assessment to the elements of assessment for that module which have been failed. The re-assessment mark for the module will then be a combination (on the same basis as in Regulation 6 of the Award of credit section above) of the marks from the elements of assessment passed first time and the elements of assessment which have been re-assessed.\n15.\nAll re-assessments must be undertaken before the student progresses to the next stage (but see Regulation 20 below). All reassessments will take place in August/September immediately following the first assessment (but see Regulations 16 and 20 below), except:\nWhere a School agrees to a written request from the student to take the reassessment at a later date. Such requests must be made before the deadline published on the Student Services website ahead of the August/September reassessment period;\nWhere a School arranges an earlier reassessment;\nWhere this is not possible owing to external constraints;\nWhere different arrangements are made for distance learning or part-time students.\nCircumstances where an exemption to Regulation 20 apply when the reassessment will normally take place at the next available scheduled opportunity in the academic year.\n16.\nA student may request to be allowed to repeat their enrolment in failed or incomplete modules (which will include attendance at all scheduled classes and submission of all coursework) before taking the reassessment or initial assessments. Requests should be submitted to the student’s School who must consult other relevant Schools, and, where the student is on a Tier 4 or Student route visa, the Visa and Immigration team, when making the decision. A School should (if possible) agree to such a request, but there may be circumstances where this is not possible (e.g. where the module is no longer running or where there are Tier 4 or Student route visa limitations on immigration sponsorship). If a student opts to take any one reassessment with attendance, they must then take all due reassessments with attendance (except for modules where a repeat enrolment is not available).\nFor students following a higher or degree apprenticeship course, reassessment or re-enrolment opportunities will be as above, unless Education and Skills Funding agency (ESFA) funding rules that were in force at the apprentice’s start of study date require otherwise.\nA module specification may stipulate that in order for a student to be reassessed in that module, the student must repeat their enrolment. In such circumstances, the student will not be compelled to take all reassessments in attendance and may take all other reassessments either in August/September or during the session when they are attending for the purpose of the module(s) that require attendance.\n17.\nStudents may not be re-assessed in modules (or module elements of assessment) which they have already passed.\n18.\nA student who, after re-assessment, has not completed the stage under Regulations 9-11 (of the Completion of a stage section above) will not be permitted to progress further on that course and will have no further re-assessment opportunities, except in the circumstances set out in Regulation 19 below.\n19.\nA student who, after re-assessment, has not completed the stage under Regulations 9-11 (of the Completion of a stage section above) but:\n(a)\nhas passed at least 80 credits of modules in the stage, and\n(b)\nhas an average of at least 40% across all modules in the stage will be permitted one further re-assessment in the failed modules at the next available opportunity.\nIf, after this one further re-assessment, the student has still not completed the stage under Regulations 9-11 (of the Completion of a stage section above), the student will not be permitted to progress further on the course and will have no further re-assessment opportunities.\n20.\nWhere a student is permitted to be reassessed under Regulation 13, 16 or 19, and has failed in modules worth no more than 20 credits, they may choose to proceed to the next stage of their programme but cannot be regarded as having completed that stage until the previous stage has been successfully completed.\nThere may be circumstances in which a student is unable to proceed carrying credits, for example:\n2+2 programme students coming from China and Malaysia - where the Home Office would not issue a visa unless the student has progressed\nCases where it is essential for a student to have passed (as opposed to have taken) a pre-requisite module before starting the next part of their programme\nProgression from a Foundation programme to an Honours degree\nIn those circumstances, Schools are required to have an approved Exemption from the regulation and to ensure that students are made aware of this exemption in the relevant Programme Specification. Students will not be permitted to carry 20 credits of fail and will need to have successfully passed at resit before progressing further on their programme.\nAwards\nIncludes:\nconditions of receipt; University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM)\n21.\nA student will only receive an award if they have successfully completed each necessary stage of the course leading to that award. Notwithstanding this provision, a student who has successfully completed the Qualifying and Part I stages of an Honours course and does not proceed will be awarded an Undergraduate Diploma. Equally, a student who has successfully completed the Qualifying Stage of an Honours course and does not proceed will be awarded an Undergraduate Certificate.\n* University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM)\nOwing to the requirements of the Malaysia Qualifications Agency (MQA), the option to award an Undergraduate Diploma or Undergraduate Certificate to students who do not proceed at University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) is not available.\nClassification\nIncludes:\ntable of degree classifications and abbreviations; marks contribution; borderline cases;  extenuating circumstances\n22.\nThe classifications and abbreviations for Honours degrees and Integrated Masters degrees are:\nTable of degree classifications and abbreviations\nClassification\nAbbreviation\nFirst Class\nI\nSecond Class, Division One\nII-1\nSecond Class, Division Two\nII-2\nThird Class\nIII\nThe degree classification model set out in the Quality Manual specifies the final mark ranges which apply to each class and how these are calculated and make provision for a student successfully completing an Honours degree course after reassessment to receive a Pass degree without an Honours classification. Programme Specifications state what is used for each course.\nFor more information about degree classification, please consult the following section:\nDegree classification\n23.\nOrdinary degrees, Graduate Diplomas, Graduate Certificates, Undergraduate Diplomas, Undergraduate Certificates, and Foundation Certificates may be awarded with Merit or Distinction. The mark ranges which apply for these awards may be found here:\nAssessment and marking policies\n24.\nMarks awarded for modules in the foundation or qualifying stage do not contribute to the final mark calculation except in the case of Foundation Certificates and Undergraduate Certificates. Marks awarded on reassessment do not contribute to the final mark calculation in the case of Honours and Integrated Masters degrees and for the purpose of awarding Merits and Distinctions in Regulation 23 above.\n25.\nThe stage marks will be combined to calculate the final mark according to weightings which are given in the Programme Specification. The permitted weightings are defined on the following page:\nProgramme specification guidance\n26.\nNormally the degree classification awarded is determined entirely by the final average mark (weighted by credits and year of study as defined in the programme specifications) according to the model in the Degree Classification section of the Quality Manual. There are, however, two situations in which further considerations come into play.\n(a)\nWhere the final mark falls within a borderline (as defined in the Degree Classification section of the Quality Manual). In such a case the Examiners will apply the University's standardised algorithm to determine whether the classification may be raised to the next higher classification. In considering the fraction of credits at the higher level, all modules are to be counted even those that have been excluded from the calculation of the final average under 26(b).\n(b)\nWhere the student has approved extenuating circumstances claims satisfying each of the following. The claims\ni)\nAre for modules attracting no more than 20 credits\nii)\nAre in the final stage/year for which a further attempt at the assessment has not been possible by the time of the Examination Board’s meeting.\niii)\nAre not due to examination absences covered by the self-certification policy\nIn this situation, marks from those modules only may be excluded from the calculation of the final average provided that:\ni)\nMarks from all such affected modules are discounted;\nii)\nAll non-compensatable modules have been passed;\niii)\nThe Extenuating Circumstances panel can clearly demonstrate that the final mark after the exclusion is more representative of the student’s normal performance (normally by showing that the excluded module marks are significantly anomalous);\nFor more information about degree classification, please consult the following section:\nDegree classification\nStudents may decline the application of regulation 26(b) and opt to undertake a further attempt at the affected assessments, but will not graduate until they have completed those reassessments.\nAll instances in which such exclusions are applied should be communicated to Registry and Academic Affairs, Quality and Student Management Systems Team for report to Quality and Standards Committee (QSC). Reports should be submitted at the same time as the main Examination Board recommendations in June/July (Undergraduate programmes).\nPlease send your communications to:\nSS-qsc-cases@exmail.nottingham.ac.uk\nWhen a student has experienced circumstances affecting their ability to study/take assessments in their final year of study, Examination Boards may recommend that a case be made to QSC to revisit performance in earlier years for the purposes of recommending a degree classification outside regulations. This recommendation should only be used in exceptional circumstances for cases where there is no prospect of the student undertaking first attempts within a reasonable period of time, for example, in the case of chronic or terminal illness of the student or the dependent of a student.\n27.\nThere is no discretion to lower the classification below that indicated by the final mark.\n28.\nAny of the above regulations may be varied as stated in the relevant programme specification e.g. if there is a specific stated stricter requirement by a professional body accrediting the programme, or is required to meet Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) requirements for attainment on an apprenticeship programme, or an exception has been formally approved. If such a variation is applied and results in the termination of a student's registration on that programme, the student must be offered the opportunity to transfer to a non-accredited programme providing that they satisfy the above regulations. Notwithstanding the above, where no suitable non-accredited programme can exist or where local government requirements prohibit the award of a different qualification from that which the student was studying, students will receive the relevant non-accredited qualification equivalent to the number of credits they have already accrued unless local requirements prohibit fallback awards.  Where this is the case it must be stated in the relevant programme specification.\n29.\nFor apprenticeship programmes:\nOn integrated apprenticeship programmes the End-Point Assessment serves as a final credit bearing module for the degree. It also constitutes the summative assessment for the apprenticeship award. Each specific End-Point Assessment plan outlines the final classification criteria for the apprenticeship award.\nOn non-integrated apprenticeship programmes, the End-Point Assessment is undertaken after completion of the degree, and is taken as a standalone assessment external to the University.\nGuidance and additional links\nIncludes:\nRegistry and Academic Affairs; flow chart of progression, compensation and reassessment; Regulations for students who do not meet Honours requirements\nStudents seeking advice on these regulations should contact Registry and Academic Affairs. For more information, please consult the following:\nRegistry and Academic Affairs\nPlease also see the flow chart of progression, compensation and reassessment for undergraduate honours courses, and the guidance for Schools.\nFlow chart of progression, compensation and reassessment for undergraduate honours courses\nRegulations for students who do not meet Honours requirements from September 2015\n* In consideration that not all students who entered Part I in September 2020 may be aware of the changes to borderline criteria which would be applied from summer 2022,  the borderline criteria taking effect from September 2020 will apply only to students who entered Qualifying year from September 2020 onwards. Students in a borderline, who entered Qualifying year prior to September 2020, will  be considered under the regulations applicable pre-September 2020.\nIf you have a problem or query relating to these regulations, please email:\nug-regulations@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n05 March 2025||"

A School offering a module has the right to refuse admission to that module.\nFor more information about the University's Qualifications Framework, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\n3.\nIn making their selection of modules, students must satisfy any prerequisites, corequisites or other requirements set out in the relevant module or programme specification.\n4.\nStudents may not select taught modules worth more than 80 credits in any one semester.\n5.\nThe work presented for assessment for an award of a taught postgraduate qualification must be the result of work done mainly while the candidate is registered as a student of this University.\nAward of credit\nIncludes:\npass mark; components; failure to pass; Recognition of Other Learning (ROL)\n6.\nThe pass mark for a module comprising part of a Master's, Postgraduate Diploma or Postgraduate Certificate programme is 50%.\n7.\nThe module specification states how the components of the module will be combined to form a module mark and whether a particular mark must be gained in individual components of the module in order for the module as a whole to be passed. A student who passes the module will be awarded the credit for that module.\n8.\nA student who fails to pass a module may nevertheless be awarded the credit for that module in the circumstances set out in Regulations 10 and 11 (in the Completion of a stage section) below.\n9.\nCredit may also be awarded under the University’s policy on Recognition of Other Learning (formerly known as Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL)). For more information, please consult the following:\nRecognition of Other Learning\nCompletion of a stage\nIncludes:\nfailure of one or more modules; progression requirements\n10.\nStudents will normally proceed directly from the taught stage of their course to the dissertation/project stage. Where a student is undertaking assessment in August/September, they may request a deferral of the dissertation/project stage enabling them to undertake this in the next academic year. Where Schools require students to pass pre-requisite modules or demonstrate achievement of learning outcomes before proceeding to the dissertation stage, this will be explicitly stated in the relevant programme specification.\n11.\nA student who fails one or more modules for the taught stage of the course will still complete that stage and so be awarded the total credit for that stage provided that:\nThey have passed modules worth at least two-thirds of the taught stage credits, and\nThey have a weighted average for the taught stage of at least 50% with no module marks of less than 40%\nNotwithstanding the above, module marks below 40% for up to 20 credits will be compensated if the student has passed modules worth at least 80 credits and has a weighted average of at least 50%.\n12.\nA course may only have progression requirements more stringent than those stated in Regulation 11 above if there is a demonstrable requirement from a  Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Body (PSRB), or is required to meet Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) requirements for attainment on an apprenticeship programme. Students who fail to satisfy the requirements of such a course but who nonetheless satisfy the progression criteria as stated in Regulations 10 and 11 will be eligible for the award of a named non-accredited degree.\n13.\nRegulation 11 will not apply to any module which is listed in the relevant programme specification as not compensatable. A student who fails such a module will not complete that stage without successfully undertaking reassessment in that module. The Master's dissertation/project stage will always be non-compensatable.\nReassessment\nIncludes:\nstudent rights; potential scenarios; further reassessment\n14.\nA student who, at the first attempt, has not satisfactorily completed the taught stage or dissertation/project stage of the course has a right to one reassessment in each failed module where this might enable a student to satisfy programme requirements. All reassessments will take place in August/September immediately following the first assessment, except:\nWhere a School agrees to a written request from the student to take the reassessment at a later date (such requests must be made before the August/September reassessment period);\nWhere a School arranges an earlier reassessment;\nWhere this is not possible owing to external constraints;\nWhere different arrangements are made for distance learning or part-time students.\nThe form of the reassessment will be the same as for the first attempt for taught modules unless stated otherwise in the module specification. The full marks gained on reassessment will be used for determining whether compensation can occur under the provision of Regulation 11 (in the Completion of a stage section) above.\n15.\nWhere a student has pass marks in one or more components of the module, but has failed the module overall, the School delivering the module will limit the reassessment to the elements of assessment for that module which have been failed. The reassessment mark for the module will then be a combination (on the same basis as in Regulation 7 of the Award of credit section above) of the marks from the elements of assessment passed first time and the elements of assessment which have been reassessed.\n16.\nA student may request to be allowed to repeat their enrolment in failed modules (which will include attendance at all scheduled classes and submission of all coursework) before taking the reassessments. Requests should be submitted to the student’s School who must consult other relevant Schools and, where the student is on a Tier 4 visa, the Visa and Immigration team, when making the decision. A School should (if possible) agree to such a request, but there may be circumstances where this is not possible (e.g. where the module is no longer running or where there are Tier 4 limitations on immigration sponsorship). If a student opts to take any one reassessment with attendance, they must then take all due reassessments with attendance (except for modules where a repeat enrolment is not available).\nFor students following a higher or degree apprenticeship course, reassessment or re-enrolment opportunities will be as above, unless Education and Skills Funding agency (ESFA) funding rules that were in force at the apprentice’s start of study date require otherwise.\nA module specification may stipulate that, in order for a student to be reassessed in a particular module, the student must repeat their enrolment in that module. In such circumstances, the student will not be compelled to take all reassessments in attendance and may take all other reassessments either in August/September or during the session when they are attending for the purpose of the module(s) that require attendance.\n17.\nStudents may not be reassessed in modules (or module elements of assessment) they have already passed.\n18.\nA student who, after reassessment, has not passed assessments as specified in these regulations and the relevant programme specification may be permitted one further reassessment in up to one-third of taught stage credits provided:\n(a)\nA mark of at least 40% has been obtained in either first or second sitting, and\n(b)\nThe student has an overall credit-weighted average of 50%.\nIf, after this one further reassessment, the student has still not passed assessments as specified in these regulations and the relevant programme specification, they will have no further reassessment opportunities.\nAwards\nIncludes:\nrequirements; Postgraduate Diplomas or Certificates\n19.\nA student will only receive a Master's award if they have successfully completed both the taught and dissertation/project stages of their course. A student who does not successfully complete the dissertation/project stage will be awarded a Postgraduate Diploma or Certificate if they have gained a pass mark of 50% or more in modules worth 120 credits (60 credits for the Postgraduate Certificate), or satisfy the requirements of Regulations 10 and 11 (of the Completion of a stage section) above unless PSRB, relevant apprenticeship standard or local government regulations preclude this. For the purposes of the award of the Postgraduate Diploma the dissertation mark will count. Students on a 2 year taught Master's programme who achieve 180 credits may also be eligible for a Master's award, either a named fallback award specified in the programme specification or, where such does not exist, the generic Master of Combined Studies, subject to meeting the criteria for those awards.\n20.\nPostgraduate Diplomas or Certificates awarded under Regulation 19 above will have the same subject title as the Master's course on which the student was registered, unless the programme specification states an alternative subject title for those being awarded Diplomas or Certificates.\n21.\nThe provisions of Regulations 19 and 20 above also apply to the award of Postgraduate Certificates to students registered on a Postgraduate Diploma course.\nClassification\nIncludes:\nreassessment contributions; extenuating circumstances; borderlines; variation\n22.\nPostgraduate Master's, Diploma and Certificates will be awarded with Merit to students who achieve a final credit-weighted mark of at least 60% and with Distinction to students who achieve a final credit-weighted mark of at least 70%.\n23.\nMarks awarded on reassessment do not contribute to the final mark for the purpose of awarding Merits and Distinctions in Regulation 22 above; instead the mark gained on the first attempt at the module will be used. Marks awarded on reassessment will, however, count towards attaining a Pass in the course overall.\n24.\nNormally the degree classification awarded is determined entirely by the final average mark (weighted by credits and year of study as defined in the programme specifications) according to the model in the Degree Classification section of the Quality Manual.\nFor more information about this model, please consult the following:\nDegree classification\nThere are, however two situations in which further considerations come into play.\n(a)\nWhere the final mark falls within a borderline (as defined in the Degree Classification section of the Quality Manual). In such a case the Examiners will apply the University's standardised algorithm (as described in the award classification section of the Quality Manual) to determine whether the classification may be raised to the next higher classification. In considering the fraction of credits at the higher level, all modules are to be counted even those that have been excluded from the calculation of the final average under 24(b).\n(b)\nWhere the student has approved extenuating circumstances claims satisfying each of the following. The claims\ni)\nAre for modules attracting no more than 20 credits\nii)\nAre in the final stage/year for which a further attempt at the assessment has not been possible by the time of the Examination Board’s meeting.\niii)\nAre not due to examination absences covered by the self-certification policy\nIn this situation, marks from those modules only may be excluded from the calculation of the final average provided that:\ni)\nMarks from all such affected modules are discounted;\nii)\nAll non-compensatable modules have been passed;\niii)\nThe Extenuating Circumstances panel can clearly demonstrate that the final mark after the exclusion is more representative of the student’s normal performance (normally by showing that the excluded module marks are significantly anomalous);\nStudents may decline the application of regulation 24(b) and opt to undertake a further attempt at the affected assessments, but will not graduate until they have completed those reassessments.\nAll instances in which such exclusions are applied should be communicated to Registry and Academic Affairs for report to Quality and Standards Committee (QSC). Reports should be submitted at the same time as the main Examination Board recommendations in November (Taught Postgraduate programmes).\nFor more information, please email:\nRegistry and Academic Affairs (Quality and Student Management System Team)\n25.\nThere is no discretion to lower the classification below that indicated by the final mark.\n26.\nAny of the above regulations may be varied as stated in the relevant programme specification where an exception has been formally approved.  If such a variation is applied and results in the termination of a student's registration on that programme, the student must be offered the opportunity to transfer to a non-accredited programme providing that they satisfy the above regulations. Notwithstanding the above, where no suitable non-accredited programme can exist or where local government requirements prohibit the award of a different qualification from that which the student was studying, students will receive the relevant non-accredited qualification equivalent to the number of credits they have already accrued unless local requirements prohibit fallback awards. Where this is the case it must be stated in the relevant programme specification.\n27.\nFor apprenticeship programmes:\nOn integrated apprenticeship programmes the End-Point Assessment serves as a final credit bearing module for the degree. It also constitutes the summative assessment for the apprenticeship award. Each specific End-Point Assessment plan outlines the final classification criteria for the apprenticeship award.\nOn non-integrated apprenticeship programmes, the End-Point Assessment is undertaken after completion of the degree, and is taken as a standalone assessment external to the University.\nAdditional information\nIncludes:\nsupplementary regulations for UK-based courses; international campuses; assessment policies and extenuating circumstances; progression and examples\nSupplementary regulations for UK-based courses\nFor more information about Supplementary Regulations for courses running in the UK, please consult the following:\nCurriculum Catalogue\nInternational campuses\nFor more information about courses running at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC), please consult the following:\nPostgraduate Taught study (UNNC)\nFor more information about courses running at the University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM), please consult the following:\nPostgraduate study (UNM)\nAssessment policies and extenuating circumstances\nFor more information about assessment policies and extenuating circumstances, please consult the following:\nAssessment overview and School responsibilities\nExtenuating circumstances\nProgression\nFlow charts covering application of progression, compensation and reassessment regulations for programmes at Master's level are available: a chart including a progression point and without a progression point can be found here:\nPGT progression, compensation and reassessment flowchart\nPGT progression, compensation and reassessment flowchart (no progression point)\nA flow chart covering application of progression, compensation and reassessment regulations for Postgraduate Certificate/Diploma programmes is available here:\nPGT Flowchart for PGCert and PGDip (from 2012)\nFurther information\nSchools can obtain guidance on these regulations by emailing:\npg-regulations@nottingham.ac.uk\nStudents seeking advice on these regulations should consult the following:\nRegistry and Academic Affairs\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n24 June 2024||"

        "content": "Voluntary interruption of study - The University of NottinghamVoluntary interruption of study\nThis page provides information on the process and associated implications that apply when a student wishes to interrupt their studies. This information is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Please note that students in the UK on a Student Route visa are also affected by the University's Policy on Immigration Sponsorship. Where academic policies and immigration policies seem to be contradictory, immigration policies will take precedence. For more information, please consult the following:\nImmigration sponsorship\n1.0 Purpose\nStudents may, for a variety of reasons, want to interrupt their studies. Voluntary Interruption of study is one of the ways the University can support students through personal difficulty and can also be used in other time-limited circumstances (for example, by SU sabbatical officers).\n2.0 Key Principles\n2.1 Effects of interrupting study\nWhen a student interrupts their study, their registration with the University will be temporarily suspended and all relevant authorities (where known) will be informed.\nA student whose registration is suspended because of voluntary interruption of study is not entitled to attend any teaching or take any assessments and will not pay tuition fees in accordance with the University’s fee schedule. However, they are still subject to other, relevant regulations of the University, such as the Traffic Regulations, the Regulations for Library and Computer Use and the University’s Code of Discipline for Students.\n2.2 Reasons for agreeing to requests to interrupt studies\nThe considerations to be applied by the school in making the decision to agree an interruption are:\nWhether interruption is inevitable owing to extenuating circumstances such as injury, illness, or unavoidable family commitments; or\nThe reasons cited by the student indicate that it would genuinely be in their best academic, financial, or personal interest to interrupt their studies; and\nSignificant curriculum changes are not likely to occur during the period of interruption such as to make it difficult for the student to resume their studies.\nFor apprentices, consideration may also be made where situations, such as work-based commitments, are affecting the ability to meet the required off-the-job training hours for study over a period of longer than four weeks.\nSchools may wish to consider or request supporting evidence (for example, from medical or counselling services) before agreeing to an interruption. For more information, please consult the Extenuating circumstances page.\n2.3 Timing of interruptions\nAn interruption of study may begin immediately in cases where a student’s absence from the University is unavoidable or urgently required. In all other cases, the interruption of study of taught course students must begin from the end of a semester (that is, after the end of the examinations attached to that semester) so that there is a clearly identifiable point at which a return to studies will occur.\nThe interruption of a research student’s study will usually commence at the beginning of a month.\nInterruptions must not be granted just before the start of examinations simply as a means of allowing students to avoid (or postpone) failure in a number of modules, as this would provide these students with an unmerited advantage.\n2.4 Implications for the immigration status of international students in the UK\nStudents who are considering an interruption of study or who are advised to interrupt must be advised to consult the Visa and Immigration Team for immigration advice before submitting their interruption request to the Student Service Centre or equivalent office. The request to interrupt study form also ensures that relevant students are in receipt of immigration advice before proceeding with any change of circumstances.\nA student's ability to repeat modules in attendance, as detailed in the 'Return to study' section below, may be restricted by the University's limitations on immigration sponsorhip policy and this must be taken into account when considering a request for interruption.\n2.5 Period of interruption and maximum period of study from initial registration\nAn interruption must be for a definite period. Where it would seem insensitive to designate a date of return to studies, the student may be informed that the interruption is until a proposed date but subject to review and the proposed return date will be entered into relevant systems. In this case, Registry and Academic Affairs in the UK, Student Registry at UNM or Academic Affairs Office at UNNC must be informed by the school annually whether the interruption is continuing. In some cases, it may be appropriate for the school to require a student to provide medical certification of fitness to return to study before allowing re-registration to occur.\nThe University requires all students to complete their programme within a set period after initial registration regardless of individual circumstances. These are laid down in the guidelines on Maximum periods from initial registration. For more information, please consult the Maximum period from initial registration page linked below.\nA School must refuse to allow a student to interrupt their study if that would result in it being impossible for that student to complete their studies within the defined time frames or those imposed by external requirements or individual programme specifications.\n2.6 Return to study\nWhere an interruption is granted, the School may require the student (on their return) to repeat modules already passed where the syllabus for that module has been updated, or to take new modules to replace outdated modules previously passed. In these cases, the marks from the repeated or new modules will replace the marks gained from the outdated modules.\nWhere a student is on an accredited degree or a programme leading to professional registration and their normal period of study has been extended it may be necessary for them to undertake additional assessment in order to prove competency prior to conferral of their award.\nA student who has interrupted their study will change cohort on their return to study and the regulations applying to the cohort they have joined will be applicable, which may have implications for their progression or final award for the programme. Undergraduate and postgraduate taught students will be sent a return to study form at least one month prior to returning from an interruption of study requesting confirmation of the return to study details.\nFor apprentices, the School will agree with the employer and apprentices the most appropriate point for return to study which would usually be expected to be up to 12 months. Funding rules prevent apprentices from undertaking repeat learning. Adjustment of the apprentice’s individual learning plan will be undertaken.\nIn circumstances where the Voluntary Interruption of Study comes as the result of the Support to Study policy, the University reserves the right to request contemporaneous evidence that a student is able to re-engage, as required, with their studies and the University community (with or without adjustments). For more information on the Support to Study policy and procedure, please consult the pages linked below:\n3.0 Roles and responsibilities\nStudents must make their request to their school, and it is for the school to decide whether or not to recommend the interruption, taking into account the information in other sections.\nRegistry and Academic Affairs in the UK, Student Registry at UNM or Academic Affairs Office at UNNC must be informed as soon as an interruption has been recommended, in order that in can be approved on behalf of Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) and will confirm the approval and terms of the interruption in writing to the student.\nIt is the student’s responsibility to ensure that any sponsor or legal requirements are complied with when taking an interruption of study.\nFor apprentices, the Professional and Work-based Learning team will oversee the funding and contractual process. For apprentices, an interruption may require a change in the contracted agreement with the University and employer.\n4.0 Procedural steps\n4.1 Request to interrupt study forms and approval\nRequests to interrupt must be made in advance of the interruption. Retrospective interruptions of study will only be granted in exceptional circumstances (or with regard to apprenticeships please see below).\nRequests to interrupt must be made on the relevant form from the list below:\nUK campus\nRequest to interrupt study UK campus - taught students in the schools of Law, Life Sciences, Chemistry, and Departments of History and Mechanical, Materials and Manufacturing Engineering only (excluding students on apprenticeship programmes)\nRequest to interrupt study UK campus - School of Education - taught students including BA, MA, PGCE and PGCEi (excluding CELE and PGCHE)\nRequest to interrupt study (UK campus –\nall other\ntaught students)\nRequest to interrupt study (UK campus – research students)\nReturn from interruption of study (UK campus – taught students)\nAmendment to agreed interruption of study (UK campus – taught students)\nCompulsory Break in Learning Form - Apprentices (UK campus - taught students)\nUniversity of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM)\nRequest to interrupt study (UNM campus – taught and research students)\nUniversity of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC)\nRequest to interrupt study (UNNC campus – taught students)\nRequest to interrupt study (UNNC campus – research students)\n4.2 Return to study\nUndergraduate and postgraduate taught students will be sent a return to study form at least one month prior to returning from an interruption of study requesting confirmation of the return to study details.\n4.3\nAmendment to agreed interruption of study - applicable to taught students only\nStudents who have an agreed interruption of study and wish to request an amendment to the previously agreed interruption of study are advised to consult with their personal tutor and/or course director who will be able to decide if an extended interruption of study is the appropriate course of action before completing the request an amendment to agreed interruption of study form.\nIt is the student’s responsibility to ensure that any sponsor or legal requirements are complied with when amending the interruption of study. Students whose nationality is non-British/non-Irish will need to seek approval from the Visa and Immigration team before submitting the amendment to agreed interruption of study form.\nIn the case of research students who have already had an interruption of a year, any further extension will only be approved in exceptional circumstances to ensure that registration on the programme of study is not protracted over a lengthy period of time.\nFor apprentices, any interruption of studies is handled in conjunction with the Break in Learning process, as outlined in the appropriate Education and Skills Funding Agency funding rules (linked below).\n4.4 Funding issues\nSchools must always remind students of the need to consult their funding body before interrupting their study, and remind them that the University is not able to guarantee the resumption of any external grant or loan.\nIf a student interrupts their study and returns to repeat a stage or semester, the student will be charged the appropriate tuition fee for the repeat period of study.\n4.4.1 Postgraduate students with a research council or other funding award\nFor postgraduate students in the UK with a research council or other funding award, Schools and students will need to ensure that they have prior permission in writing from their funding body before informing the Student Service Centre or appropriate office of the interruption and will be required to enclose copies of the related correspondence with the interruption form in confirmation of this.\nUKRI funded students can contact:\nBR-RA-DTP-funding@nottingham.ac.uk\n. Other funders need to be contacted directly.\n4.4.2 Students holding an award under the University's Postgraduate Studentship scheme\nWhere students hold an award under the University’s Postgraduate Studentship scheme, the appropriate forms must also be completed and sent to the Finance Department. In the UK where a student is supported through research council funding the School must ensure that the appropriate information is submitted to the relevant council and that the Finance Department is informed about any suspension of the stipend.\n4.4.3 During the period of interruption\nDuring the period of interruption, students in the UK will not normally receive any statutory student support from the Government (for example, student loans) or any University bursary or scholarship (such as Core Bursary). Students must be advised to contact the Financial Support Team within Registry and Academic Affairs for advice on the financial implications of interrupting their studies. For more information, please consult link below.\n4.4.4 Apprenticeships\nFor apprentices, interruption of study (Break in Learning) will be managed and reported to the Education and Skills Funding Agency by the Professional and Work-based Learning team. Due to the nature of Break in Learning protocol, retrospective applications to schools, supported by the employer, may be necessary.\n5.0 Related regulations, policies and procedures\nWithdrawal from Study\nExtenuating circumstances\nMaximum period from initial registration\nSupport to Study policy\nSupport to Study procedure\nEducation and Skills Funding Agency\nFunding and financial support\nOptional placement year\nUK campus forms\nRequest to interrupt study UK campus - taught students in the schools of Law, Life Sciences, Chemistry, and Departments of History and Mechanical, Materials and Manufacturing Engineering only (excluding students on apprenticeship programmes)\nRequest to interrupt study UK campus - School of Education - taught students including BA, MA, PGCE and PGCEi (excluding CELE and PGCHE)\nRequest to interrupt study (UK campus –\nall other\ntaught students)\nRequest to interrupt study (UK campus – research students)\nReturn from interruption of study (UK campus – taught students)\nAmendment to agreed interruption of study (UK campus – taught students)\nCompulsory Break in Learning Form - Apprentices (UK campus - taught students)\nUniversity of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) forms\nRequest to interrupt study (UNM campus – taught and research students)\nUniversity of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC) forms\nRequest to interrupt study (UNNC campus – taught students)\nRequest to interrupt study (UNNC campus – research students)\n6.0 Version control table\nVersion Control Table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nReformatted to align with the new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework, based on content last modified on 22 September 2023\nQSC\nAugust 2024\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nUG and PGT students:\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nPGR students:\nGS-PGR@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n11 February 2025||"

For more information, please consult the following:\nAdmissions\nProgramme of study\n2.\nStudents will be admitted to a one year, full-time (two years, part-time) programme of study.\nTaught and thesis elements\n3.\nStudents are required to study modules worth 180 credits, of which a maximum of 60 credits must be obtained from taught modules at Level 4 or from the Research Training Programme run by the Researcher Academy (formerly the Graduate School) or other units offering generic training within the University, or from within any other relevant training courses run within Schools. The remaining 120-180 credits must be obtained from a thesis module at Level 4. Any taught modules and research training taken must be clearly cognate with the student’s research topic. Supervision while undertaking the thesis module will be as set out in the module specification and in line with the requirements for supervision contained in the regulations for research degrees.\n4.\nThe University’s Quality and Standards Committee has approved a variation in the number of taught credits required for this programme, as permitted under Regulation 4. of the University’s Regulations for the degree of Master of Research (MRes).\nTransfer to PhD\n5.\nA candidate shall not be permitted to count the same period of research for both the degree of Master of Research (MRes) and the degree of PhD.  However a candidate for the MRes degree may, after a period of not less than nine months study for the MRes and prior to the submission of the thesis, with the approval of the supervisor and Head of School (or equivalent), submit a transfer form to the University for permission to be registered as a candidate for the degree of PhD instead of a Master of Research.  The period of registration for the degree of PhD should normally be three years (and not less than two years) full-time from the initial date of registration for the MRes.\nAssessment\nIncludes:\nmodule specifications; submitting thesis before end of registered study; viva voce examinations\n6.\nThe assessment of all modules is as set out in the specifications for those modules. In regard to the thesis module, the maximum word length of the thesis is adjusted in accordance with the number of taught credits undertaken: such that a thesis module 120 credits should not exceed 25,000 words, a thesis of 140 credits should not exceed 30,000 words, a thesis of 160 credits should not exceed 35,000 words and a thesis of 180 credits should not exceed 40,000 words. The maximum word limit is inclusive of appendices, footnotes, tables but not the bibliography. The Thesis should embody the result of the candidate’s advanced study and research.\n7.\nStudents are required to submit their thesis prior to the end of the period of registered study. A electronic version, saved as a searchable PDF, should be submitted to the relevant Registry and Academic Affairs PGR team or equivalent, who will forward the thesis to the Examiners. The thesis should not, whether in the same or a different form, have been submitted to this or any other University for the award of any degree.\n8.\nThe thesis must be the result of the student’s own work. The requirement does not preclude a student obtaining limited assistance with proof-reading and with the routine collection and/or processing of data under guidelines and instructions clearly devised by the student. When such help is obtained it should be with the prior approval of the supervisor who must be satisfied that the spirit of the 'own work' requirement is not breached.\n9.\nThe thesis is examined by both an External Examiner and an Internal Examiner appointed under the regulations governing the assessment of research degrees, who should provide independent reports on the thesis, indicating whether the thesis module has been passed; and also whether a viva voce examination is necessary. Where a viva voce examination is required by the examiners, this should be conducted in line with the relevant regulations for MPhil degrees.\nFor more information about the Viva voce examinations, please consult the following:\nViva voce examinations\nOutcomes of examination\nIncludes:\naward of degree; where a student obtains a fail mark or failed thesis or training credits; nottingham etheses service\n10.\nThe degree is awarded where all taught modules and training credits and the thesis module have been passed. The pass mark for all taught modules is 50%, but marks of 40%-49% can be compensated in up to 20 credits if the overall average for the taught modules taken is 50% or over. Training credits will be assessed on a pass/fail basis.\n11.\nWhere a student obtains a fail mark in a taught module, or fails the thesis module or training credits, the student has one further opportunity to pass those modules. All reassessments must be completed within one year of the end of the student's period of registered study.\n12.\nThe qualification awarded to the student will include the subject of study undertaken as notified to the student at the time of admission.\n13.\nSuccessful candidates will be eligible to graduate once their thesis has been uploaded to the University’s etheses service and approved by the Internal Examiner or, in cases where there are two external examiners, the lead External Examiner.  For more information, please consult the following:\nNottingham eTheses\nStudents from countries that are not familiar with the MRes qualification may, alternatively, be awarded a MA or MSc by Research in order not to disadvantage those students.  The regulations for these awards will, though, be exactly the same as for the MRes. This will also be permitted, with QSC approval, where required by professional, regulatory or accrediting bodies.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n23 October 2024||"

        "content": "International campuses and quality assurance - The University of NottinghamInternational campuses and quality assurance\nThis page sets out the principles, responsibilities and guidance on particular areas surrounding quality assurance at the international campuses. This information is primarily directed at staff but may also be of interest to students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia.1.0 Introduction/Overview\nThe policy framework for quality assurance in which academic schools have provision across multiple campuses is outlined below.\n2.0 Purpose\nThe key aim of the principles is to ensure parity of experience and the maintenance of academic standards across all three campuses.  This is crucial to maintaining value of our degrees and to meet the requirements of the regulators in each of the jurisdiction in which we operate.\n3.0 Scope\nThis applies to staff and students in schools which have provision across multiple campuses.\n4.0 Key Principles\nSchools may have provision on one or more campus for which they have responsibility. The nature of the relationship and therefore responsibility will differ for UNM and UNNC but the principles will hold.\nThe principle of the UK having the Degree Awarding Power means that in practice all provision on all campuses must be clearly owned by a single School (even where delivery may be joint and there is no single equivalent UK School). This ensures that the same protocols around awarding of degrees is maintained\nWhere a UK School has delegated specific functions to a unit on an international campus, it should be clear that this unit forms part of that School or, at least, is performing those specific functions on behalf of that School.\n1\n1\nThis principle is of particular significance in those instances in which there is joint involvement by UK campus (UNUK) based Schools in relation to provision of a degree programme in either University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) or University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC).\n4.1 Responsibilities\nSchools have all the responsibilities set out in the Quality Manual for their entire provision across all campuses. It is the responsibility of the individual School to determine the most appropriate approach to operating its quality assurance process within the context of the broad principles outlined in the Quality Manual. Where Quality Assurance responsibilities have been delegated to particular role holders or units on the international campuses, this should be formally documented and appropriate protocols put in place via the Statement of Responsibility. Schools may have multiple Statements of Responsibilities in order to facilitate differing arrangements for different programmes/ groups of programme.\nThe Heads of School at each campus to which a Statement of Responsibilities applies should each sign-off a completed template. Schools may choose to give considerable autonomy to units on international campuses, but necessarily retain a responsibility to exercise a general monitoring function to ensure that the policies and procedures in the Quality Manual are being carried out appropriately.\nThere is an annual process to confirm continued validity of Statements of Responsibility and an opportunity for any changes to be discussed and reflected in the documentation.\nStatement of Responsibilities template\nWhere the activities of the School have repercussions for the provision of other Schools on the international campuses, or for the overall management of the campuses, the relevant managers on the international campus (e.g. the Provost, Vice Provost or Dean) must be fully involved in decision-making and there should be joint agreement as to the actions taken. By the same token, decisions of the international campus management that have repercussions for the academic activities of other Schools should be arrived at jointly with those Schools.\nIn regard to the above, and to the guidance section below, decisions made at an international campus can be regarded as having the agreement of Schools and of international campus management, so long as Schools have delegated the necessary authority to their staff on the campus.\nIn cases where agreement cannot be arrived at between Schools and the international campus management, the matter should be referred to the University's Education and Student Experience Committee (in regard to matters of academic policy) or to the Pro-Vice Chancellor (PVC) for Global Engagement (in regard to strategic or operational matters).\nProfessional Services have a responsibility for ensuring that University policies and procedures take account of the needs of all campuses and the implementation of them is supported on all campuses. This involves either direct or indirect responsibility for relevant professional services on the international campuses in co-operation with the senior management of the international campuses.\n4.2 Delegation of responsibility (in relation to the international campuses)\nOversight of academic responsibilities and the extent of delegating decision-making to units on specific campuses is at the discretion of individual Schools. However, when making these determinations, the following principles must always be followed:\nIn terms of organisational structure, academic staff in a given subject area at any campus should be regarded as members of the relevant School (although it is noted that contracts of employments may reside with separate legal entities).\nA clear protocol should exist across campuses to ensure that the appointment process makes full use of recognised expertise among existing staff when making new appointments.\nAny modules delivered across multiple campuses must observe the same standards of learning outcomes and cover the same core subject matter. It is a fundamental requirement that the content of teaching programmes is equivalent although it does not necessarily have to be identical. The title, structure (outside of compulsory modules) and content may vary between campuses so long as the learning outcomes remain the same.\nThe development of individual modules and overall degree programmes should be regarded as a collaborative process which involves staff across all campuses.\nWhere the same programmes and modules are offered on more than one campus, it is the Head of School’s responsibility to ensure that all modifications to this provision and the manner of its delivery are communicated and implemented across all campuses.\nThe status of internal examiners is equal across all campuses; where examination boards meet at the international campuses, these should be considered as having the same status as UK examination boards.\nStaff on all campuses should have the opportunity to participate in the assessment process and in award recommendations (including participation in final examination boards); a reasonable expectation might be at least one representative from international campus examination boards at the final external board. Where this is not possible, the School must ensure that there is someone present who can fully represent the view of the examiners at the relevant campus.\nStaff based at the international campuses should have the opportunity to contribute equally to the operation of quality assurance within their School.\nThe senior management of the international campuses should be consulted about specific quality assurance arrangements at School-level and their agreement secured insofar as they affect the function of those campuses.\nThe Educational Enhancement and Assurance Review (EEAR) process will review academic units at the international campuses as part of the review of a UK School. Additional reviews may be conducted as a result of local requirements and separate Campus Reviews will focus on issues regarding context and environment rather than addressing the specific provision of individual academic units.\n4.3 Guidance on particular areas\n4.3.1 Admissions\nSchools should agree entry criteria in discussion with UNM/UNNC management. Implementation of these admissions criteria is undertaken by the UNM/UNNC management with academic decision-making as necessary by relevant academic units.\n4.3.2 Internal programme approval\nIn all cases, Schools should submit business cases and programme specifications in consultation with UNM/UNNC management to Student Services/Registry and Academic Affairs (Curriculum Approvals and Advisory Team). The Provost and Vice-Provost for the relevant campus have the authority to sign off the business case, with approval for the programme specification resting with Quality and Standards Committee (QSC). The Vice-Provost, on the basis of advice and guidance from Student Services/Registry and Academic Affairs, will confirm that the proposed programme is aligned with the University of Nottingham Qualifications Framework (UNQF), the University’s study regulations and any other relevant Quality Manual provisions. If the programme deviates from these provisions in any regard, then approval is also required from the Pro-Vice Chancellor (PVC) Education and Student Experience.\nFor more information about these areas, please consult the following:\nQuality and Standards Committee\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\nAcademic regulations\nIn the case of new programmes that are delivered jointly by the international campuses and the UK campus (UNUK) (e.g. 2+2 programmes), or are programmes currently delivered in the UK that will in future be delivered also at University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM)/University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC), the Business Case is considered by the Provost of the relevant campus, in addition to the standard process for new Programme Approval.\nWhere a campus is proposing to run a programme which already exists on another campus, only the business case needs formal approval but the Programme Specification must be reviewed by QSC and the relevant campus to ensure that local delivery plans and the overarching programme specification are consistent. With respect to such ‘based on’ programmes, the new version of the programme will include the same learning outcomes and compulsory modules as the original version.\n2\n2\nAn existing Programme Specification might require revision to reflect variations in the number and range of optional subjects available which might include an increased number of compulsory modules at a campus with a more limited range of options available.\nThere is also an expectation that the title of the new programme should be the same as the original version.\n3\n3\nWhilst the expectation is that the new version of the programme will retain the same title as the original version, it is recognised that there may be circumstances where this is not possible, eg in order to meet to local regulatory or statutory requirements.\nThe Partnership Relations and Projects team within External Relations should also be informed of any proposed new programme. For programmes approved for delivery on UNM, other than those subject to professional body accreditation, 'self-accreditation' (comprising QSC receiving information confirming the satisfactory operation of the programme on UNM) must be undertaken before the first cohort of students has completed the programme.\nFor more information about programme approvals, please consult the following:\nProgramme design, development and approval\n4.3.3 Module approval\nSchools submit module specifications in consultation with international campus management to Student Services/Registry and Academic Affairs (Curriculum Approvals and Advisory Team). Where a module (as defined by its title\n4\nand learning outcomes) already exists on one of the campuses, no separate approval is required.\n4\nSimilarly, the expectation is that modules will retain the same title unless there are circumstances which mean this is not appropriate, e.g. local Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Bodies (PSRB) requirements.\nThe content, delivery format and assessment of the same module may vary between campuses, so long as the learning outcomes remain constant. In sanctioning such module differences across the campuses, the consequences of such differences on the effectiveness of student transfer between campuses must be addressed.\n4.3.4 Changes to programmes and modules\nIn those instances where approval of changes is required from beyond the School (the circumstances are set out in the relevant passages of the Quality Manual), the amended programme or module specification should be submitted by the School, in consultation with the international campus management, to Student Services/Registry and Academic Affairs (Curriculum Approvals and Advisory Team) for subsequent approval by the relevant committee.\n4.3.5 Campus reviews, Educational enhancement, assurance reviews and annual monitoring\nCampus reviews are a cyclical process, typically every 5/6 years and follow a similar process to the Quality Assurace Agency (QAA) Transnational Education review (TNE).  Reviews of programmes delivered on international campuses form part of the Educational Enhancement and Assurance Review (EEAR) process. On an annual basis programmes at UNM/UNNC will contribute to the annual monitoring process. For more information, please consult the following:\nEducational Enhancement and Assurance Review\n4.3.6 Assessment, progression and awards\nCreation of assessments and the marking thereof can be fully delegated to staff on international campuses at the discretion of individual Schools. Some moderation and comparison of performance outcomes should normally be undertaken at module level. There should be a single Board of Examiners for programmes taught on more than one campus with representation (physical or via Microsoft Teams) from all campuses; again, comparison of student performance outcomes should normally be undertaken at both stage and degree award levels.\n4.3.7 School committees\nA School's international campus staff should have the opportunity to be fully represented on School committees including at senior management level.\n5\n5\nAccording to the circumstances of individual Schools this may range from formal video conferenced meetings, to virtual attendance via circulation of papers or regular one-to-one meetings with relevant colleagues. The key requirement is that there is an identifiable mechanism for representatives from the international campuses to engage with and be heard during School decision making processes.\nA School's approach to internal communications should ensure that the international campuses are fully informed of all developments and are involved in decision-making. While it is for the individual School to determine the most appropriate mechanism for this to occur, it may be worth noting that many Schools have found it helpful to identify a Director of Internationalisation who has specific responsibility in this area.\n4.3.8 Appointment of staff\nSchools retain responsibility for staff appointed on the international campuses where the role is within a School and should have an agreed process for making such appointments.\n6\n6\nEach School/ Department /Faculty’s positions on this should be set out in their Statement of Responsibilities\n4.3.9 Personal tutors\nSchools should ensure that their tutoring arrangements as set out in their tutoring statements are operating appropriately across all campuses on which they are represented.\n7\n7\nClarification of where responsibility for tutoring statements and tutoring arrangements lie should be outlined in a School/ Department/ Faculty’s Statement of Responsibilities (i.e. Head of School in the UK, Head of School at each campus etc).\n4.3.10 Student feedback\nSchools should ensure that Staff and Student committtees (i.e Learning Community Forums or Staff Student Forums), Student Evaluation of Module (SEM) and any other related processes for securing School-level student feedback are operating on the international campuses and that proper consideration is given to feedback.\n8\n8\nClarification of where responsibility for Student Feedback in each School/ Department/ Faculty lies should be set out in their Statement of Responsibilities.\n4.3.11 Complaints and appeals\nSchools should consider student complaints and academic appeals in accordance with the principles of the associated policies and the relevant published procedures. Any local deviations from core procedures must be approved by QSC and accessible to relevant students.\n4.3.12 Research students\nSchools have responsibility for ensuring that Quality Manual requirements are implemented for their research students on the international campuses.\n9\n9\nArrangements for responsibility of this implementation should be set out in each School/ Department/ Faculty’s Statement of Responsibilities.\n4.3.13 Students with disabilities\nSchools and the international campus management should arrange jointly for a Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) to be available for all international campus students.\nFor more information about the DLO role, please consult the following:\nStudents with disabilities\n4.3.14 Careers information, advice and guidance\nSchools, international campus management and the Careers and Employability Service have joint responsibility for ensuring that careers advice is delivered to international campus students in line with the Quality Manual.\n10\n10\nArrangements for responsibility of aspects of Careers Information, Advice and Guidance that fall to the School should be set out in the School/ Department/ Faculty’s Statement of Responsibilities.\n4.3.15 Communications and staff visits\nGiven the use of different email domains in UNNC and UNM, Schools and Professional services should identify appropriate mechanisms to ensure that information flows between different locations in a timely fashion. Face-to-face meetings can be of particular value and, while noting the University’s carbon management plan, a limited number of annual visits (in both directions) would be considered desirable.\n5.0 Version control table\nVersion control table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nReformatted to align with new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework; Content also reviewed and updated to reflect the current relationship between UNUK, UNM and UNNC\nQSC\nMarch 2024\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n13 May 2024||"

        "content": "Regulations for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and Master of Philosophy (MPhil) - The University of NottinghamRegulations for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and Master of Philosophy (MPhil)\nThis page contains the regulations for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and Master of Philosophy (MPhil). Its content is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Overview\nAll teaching and assessment must be in English when students are registered for a University of Nottingham qualification. The only exception is where the subject of study is a language or literature other than English.\nThese regulations state the minimum requirements for students undertaking a PhD or MPhil. Where any other body, such as a sponsor or collaborative partner, is involved in a student’s study, additional requirements may be agreed and must be satisfied in order for the student to be considered for an award.\nAdmission requirements\n1.\nRequirements for admission to a research degree are set out in the University of Nottingham’s Quality Manual in the section entitled Admissions, which can be found here:\nAdmissions\nCourse of study\nIncludes:\nframeworks; full-time students undertaking paid employment; counting same period of registration; staff submitting publications; submission by a staff candidate for a research degree document; part-time students\n2.\nPeriods of registration for these degrees are as set out in the University of Nottingham Qualifications Framework (UNQF). For more information about the UNQF, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\nThe student’s School may permit up to one year of registration at Nottingham (two years in the case of part-time students) to be replaced by prior study at another institution.\n3.\nFull-time students may only undertake paid employment with the permission of their School and in accordance with the requirements of any scholarship they hold. In approving a request to undertake such employment, a School must assure itself that such work will not interfere with the student’s programme of study.\n4.\nA student is not permitted to count the same period of registration for both the degree of MPhil and the degree of PhD. However, a student registered for an MPhil degree may, with the permission of their School, be allowed to transfer their registration to a PhD degree. The procedure for transferring registration is set out below in paragraphs 12 and 13 of the annual review and progression section. It is also possible to transfer from a Master’s degree by examination course to the degree of MPhil with the permission of the School.\n5.\nMembers or former members of the University staff may submit publications for a research degree of the University but must do so in accordance with the published supplementary regulations for staff candidates.  The PhD by publication route is not available for candidates wishing to register at UNNC.\nSubmission of published works guidance for staff candidates and advisors\n6.\nFor part-time students registered on a standard research degree programme (i.e not a staff candidate route) and holding an appointment within the University, the minimum period of registration may be reduced to three years.\nPGR Progression monitoring and formal Progression Review\nIncludes:\nconfirmation review; minimum elements of a progression review; final progression review; possible outcomes\n7.\nAll postgraduate researchers (PGRs) registered on research degrees lasting more than one year full-time or two years part-time (e.g. MPhil or Professional Doctorates but not MRes etc) are subject to progression monitoring throughout the year and formal assessment at Progression Review, usually annually. The purpose of progression monitoring and review is to ensure that the PGR is making satisfactory progress towards successfully completing their research and thesis examination (including any viva voce examination) to the required standard in the appropriate time.\nFor more information on the maximum period from initial registration for completion of studies, please consult the following:\nMaximum period from initial registration for completion of studies\nThe basic principles of the formal Progression Review are common to all research candidates  and all years of their programme. There are specific requirements relating to PGRs registered for a PhD dependent on the length and stage of the candidate’s  programme of study.\nFor more information on the process and structure of PGR progression monitoring and review, please consult the following:\nPGR Progression Review - Process Map\n8.\nPGR progression monitoring occurs through regular meetings with the supervisory team beginning on first registration and continuing throughout the programme of study. The supervision records form part of the formal assessment in Progression Review at each Stage of study.\nIf /when the supervisors feel that the PGR's progress during the year is unsatisfactory this must be discussed with the PGR and recorded in the supervison record.\nAll doctoral PGR's should aim to complete the thesis examination within a maximum of four years of first registration irrespective of programme duration, unless the PGR holds an award with terms and conditions that vary this maximum period and the School approves the arrangement.\nFor more detailed information about the informal and formal aspects of the Progression Review process for research students, please consult the following:\nProgression review of research students\n9.\nStages of PGR Study and Progression, and timing of formal Progression Reviews\nFormal assessment of progression through the Progression Review will take place at a time appropriate for the PGR and/or aligned with a School annual process, but should normally be completed by the end of each completed year of study. It is strongly recommended that preparations for the formal Progression Review assessment (e.g. submission of the written report) should begin before the PGR has completed nine months of each year of study and that reviews are held around the nine-month period. This is to allow for any remedial actions on progress and required re-assessment to be completed within the year of study.\nFor PGRs registered for non-doctoral degrees (e.g. MPhil), progression from Stage 1 usually occurs after the first year of full-time study (with equivalent pro rata timing for part-time PGRs). For these PGRs Stage 2 can be omitted, and Stage 3 represents confirmation of satisfactory progression towards thesis completion and submission. This is determined by assessment of the PGR’s progress towards the level 7 QAA and UNQF outcomes at Stage 3 Progression review.\nFor more information about the UNQF, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\nFor doctoral PGRs on 3 and 3.5 year programmes:\nIn Stage 1, the status of doctoral PGRs as doctoral candidates is probationary. Progression Review to Stage 2 includes confirmation that 1) the PGR is meeting the appropriate published criteria  and 2) their status as doctoral candidates.\nFor more information about Assessment criteria for Progression Reviews, please consult the following:\nAssessment criteria for Progression Reviews\nStage 2 Progression Review confirms the PGR has demonstrated sufficient progress to achieve the doctoral outcomes within the next 12-18 months with reference to the published criteria. Stage 3 Progression Review confirms the achievement of progress sufficient to meet the doctoral outcomes at thesis examination within 6 months. Progression to Stage 3 will therefore normally occur approximately 6 months before the end of the period of registered study.\nAnd\nFor doctoral PGRs on 4 year programmes containing a large component of mandatory elements in the first year of registered study, such as substantial training and development requirements, taught modules, or laboratory / research project rotations, Stage 1 Progression Review should take place at the most appropriate time for the PGR depending on the programme, but prior to the end of the second year (and the review processes thereafter on an annual basis). Subsequent Progression Reviews are scheduled at the same intervals/times as for 36 and 42 month programmes as above.\nThe formal assessment at Stage 3 Progression Review is expected to be held at least 6 months before the end of the period of registered study with a view to thesis examination within this period. If progress is insufficient for thesis submission within the period of registered study, a further Stage 3 Progression Review may take place during the Thesis-pending period.\nFor more information about the Thesis-pending period, please consult the following:\nThesis-pending period\nThe Stage 3 Progression Review can be conducted by the supervisory team but should not be conducted by a single supervisor. It is strongly recommended that where possible the Internal Assessor is also involved in the Stage 3 Progression Review for continuity and quality assurance purposes.\nFor more information on required timelines for Progression Review and timings, please consult the following:\nProgression review of research students\n10.   Minimum elements of the formal assessment at Progression Review\nProgression Reviews at Stages 1 and 2 must involve an Internal Assessor. Continued involvement of the Internal Assessor is recommended at Stage 3 Progression Review. The appointment of the Internal Assessor should be confirmed to the PGR and School at least 3 months prior to the start of the Stage 1 formal Progression Review process. More than one Internal Assessor may be appointed if required for specific reasons.\nFor more information on role, responsibilities and appointment of the Internal Assessor, please consult the following:\nRole and responsibilities of the Internal Assessor\nProgression Reviews at Stages 1 and 2 should use the core Review elements below, and may include additional methods of assessment deemed necessary by Schools, to assess progress to date against the Stage appropriate published criteria. When including additional elements Schools must pay due regard to PGR and Assessor assessment load.\nFor more information about Assessment criteria for Progression Reviews, please consult the following:\nAssessment criteria for Progression Reviews\nThe following elements should be included in the formal Progression Review process:\nA meeting between the PGR and Internal Assessor for assessment of the written report and plans for the research.\nFormative verbal feedback on performance from the Internal Assessor at the end of the meeting, whether performance was good or poor;\nIndependent written assessments from the Internal Assessor and supervisory team on the PGR’s performance to date, and a response from the PGR.\nConfirmation that the required minimum number of supervision sessions has taken place, that supervision records are available, and that these record the progress made to date highlighting any problems encountered.\nWhere required for the programme, provision of evidence to the Internal Assessor that the PGR has attended any modules and passed any assessments that form a compulsory part of their research programme.\nWhere the PGR is sponsored and reports have been submitted to the sponsor during the year, the content of those reports should form part of the consideration.\nFor more detail on the requirements on the different aspects of the Progression Review, please consult the following:\nProgression review of research students\nThe Stage 3 Progression Review can be conducted by the supervisory team but should not be conducted by a single supervisor. It is however strongly recommended that where possible the Internal Assessor is involved in the Stage 3 Progression Review.\nProgression Review at Stage 3 (progression to thesis examination) must include all the elements above with the following additions and adjustments to assess progress towards achievement of doctoral outcomes:\na detailed consideration of progress, including the progress already made on writing the thesis, and a detailed plan for thesis completion and submission within the period of registered study.\nIf submission within the registered period of study for the programme (for 36 or 42 month programmes) is not deemed possible based on progress to date, then plans should address how the PGR will ensure final thesis examination within a maximum of 4 years (for doctoral PGRs) from first registration. This should include discussion of any exceptional circumstances, unforeseen problems and mitigations that have been necessary to ensure progression and timely completion.\nIf a PGR has extenuating circumstances which may affect their attendance at or performance in the Progression Review, they should refer to the policy and procedure for extenuating circumstances to request an extension to the date set for the Progression Review.\nFor more information on circumstances affecting the ability to complete the Progression Review assessment, please consult the following:\nPolicy on circumstances affecting students' ability to study and complete assessments\n11.   Formal Progression Review recommendations\nFor PGRs undergoing Progression Review at all Stages:\nIn light of the review at Stages 1 and 2, the internal assessor and the supervisory team should first provide independent reports on the PGR's progress. The PGR should be invited to respond to these reports. The reports and response should be discussed and a joint recommendation on progress made to the PGR’s Head of School on the outcome.\nIf the Internal Assessor and supervisory team cannot agree on the recommendation, the supervisory team and Internal Assessor should discuss the review with the Head of School in order to reach an agreement. The PGR should also be aware of such discussions, and where appropriate be included in them.\nFor more information on resolution of Progression Review outcomes please consult the following:\nProgression review of research students\nPGR Progression Review - Process Map\nFor probationary doctoral PGRs at Stage 1 review:\nAs above, including whether the joint recommendation includes confirmation of PhD registration to the PGR’s Head of School.\nFor doctoral PGRs at Stage 3 review:\nAs above, including an additional statement on whether plans for thesis completion are sufficiently robust to result in completion of a thesis of the required quality and examination within the period of registered study, OR if not, completion of a thesis of the required quality and examination within a maximum of 4 years from initial registration.\nAll reports on the outcome of the Review, and all supervision records should be available to the assessing staff and the PGR.\n12.   The possible outcomes of formal Progression Review\nWhere the Supervisory team and Internal Assessor recommendations agree, the joint recommendation to the University can be either:\nThat the PGR progresses to the next stage:\nFor Stage 1 PhD PGRs, this includes confirmation of PhD status.\nFor all Stages, this means re-registration in the following academic session on the same degree (unless the PGR has reached the end of the registered length of the programme).\nFor PGRs in Stage 3 who have reached the end of their period of registered study and who have satisfied the minimum period of registration and completed their research, the recommendation will be entry to the thesis completion and submission period.\nFor PGRs at all Stages: With the agreement of the PGR, the recommendation in the joint report can be to transfer registration to another, usually higher, degree (e.g. from MPhil to PhD).\nFor more information on the necessary process required before transfer, please consult the following:\nProgression review of research students\nOr\nThat the PGR does not progress to the next stage and has an opportunity for reassessment:\nAt all Stages, this recommendation includes a referral for reassessment. The PGR is registered/re-registered for PhD in the following academic session. Stage 1 PGR's remain on probationary status until successful re-assessment and confirmation of Stage 1 progression.\nFor Stage 3 PGRs who have made insufficient progress to allow them to meet the doctoral outcomes within the following 6 months, the assessors may recommend a reassessment of the PGR's ability to meet the doctoral outcomes after 3 months, with a plan of supportive or corrective action.\nFor Stage 3 PGR's who have made insufficient progress in the research to allow them  to meet the doctoral outcomes and submit the thesis for examination within the following 6 months, the assessors may recommend an exceptional extension to the PGR’s period of registration for up to one further year. Reassessment for progression to Stage 3 should be done after no more than 6 months. Thesis completion and examination are still expected within the 4 year maximum period.\nThe maximum number of Progression Reviews at any stage is limited to two unless extenuating circumstances are accepted, in which case a further First Sit Progression Review may be conducted.\nIn these cases, supervisory records must be kept, and should be available for the re-assessment.\nOr\nThat the PGR does not progress to the next stage, and:\nAt all Stages, and with the agreement of the PGR, the PGR transfers to registration for another degree (e.g. from PhD to MPhil, or MPhil to MRes) without the need for re-assessment. In this case formal transfer of degree must be done.\nThe reasons for a recommendation for reassessment or registration on another degree must be explained to the PGR as soon as possible. When reassessment is required, the specific requirements for improvement must be made clear. Where the Internal Assessor is likely to make this recommendation, this should be fed back verbally at the Progression Review meeting.\nThe supervisory team can be invited to attend the Progression Review for the informal feedback from the Internal Assessor.\nIf the independent recommendations from the Supervisory team and Internal Assessor disagree, this should be resolved by discussion, which may involve the Head of School or delegate. Once resolved, the processes for ‘Progression recommended’ or ‘Progression not recommended’ should be followed.\nFor further details on the resolution process in the event of such a disagreement, please consult the following.\nProgression review of research students\nPGR Progression Review - Process Map\n13.   Reassessment of progression\nWhen reassessment is required before progression can be confirmed, PGRs must be given the requirements for improved performance with SMART objectives/goals, and agree with the assessors an appropriate and defined timeframe in which to meet these. The PGR must be aware of the possible outcomes of the reassessment process (Section 14) and must receive support in achieving the required improvements.\nReassessment of progression has the same format as the Progression Review.\nFor further information on the requirements and processes for PGRs recommended for remedial support and reassessment, please consult the following:\nProgression review of research students\n14.\nThe possible outcomes of re-assessment Progression Reviews are:\nIf performance in the re-assessment meets the stated criteria, and the required improvement has been made as agreed by the assessors, the recommendation by the School to the University should be that:\nFor Stage 1 PhD, PGRs receive confirmation of doctoral status.\nAt all Stages, the PGR is re-registered on the same degree.\nPGRs in Stage 3 who have reached the end of their period of registered study and who have satisfied the minimum period of registration and completed their research enter the thesis completion and submission period.\nIf performance in the re-assessment does not meet the criteria and the required improvement has not been achieved as agreed by the supervisory team, Internal Assessor and PGR, the recommendation by the School to the University should be that, for all PGRs at all stages:\nthe PGR is required to re-register on another, usually lower degree (e.g. PhD to MPhil, MPhil to MRes).\nOr\nthe PGR’s registration be terminated.\nTermination of registration can only be recommended when supported by evidence that the PGR has received written warnings on lack of progress during the period of study, and the period of supported improvement. In all such cases, all records of supervisory meetings and the Progression Review process must be submitted to QSC for scrutiny and approval before termination of registration.\nThesis-pending period\nIncludes:\nexceptional circumstances; Application for an Extension to the Thesis-pending Period document; examples that would/not warrant an extension\n15.\nStudents whose programme of study lasts for less than 4 years (8 years in the case of part-time students) and who have completed their research and the period of registered study as required by regulations may enter the thesis-pending period. In all cases the thesis must be submitted within 4 years (full-time) or 8 years (part-time) of the start of study or within 12 months (full-time) or 24 months (part-time) of the end of registration, whichever is the lesser unless the terms and conditions of a studentship held by an individual vary this.\nIn the Thesis-pending period the student will be entitled to the use of library facilities and University computing facilities but not to facilities for research. The PGR and supervisors must continue to meet regularly,\nin line with minimum requirements\n. Supervisors must read and comment on one draft of the candidate’s thesis prior to each submission (as appropriate), when submitted within the required timeframes for feedback to be given.\nMore information on the Thesis-pending period can be found here:\nThesis-pending period (including Policy on extension)\n16.\nIn exceptional circumstances an extension to the Thesis-pending period may be granted subject to the following conditions.  Requests for extensions will only be considered as a result of circumstances affecting the Thesis-pending period, and not for the period of registered study. If an extension request is granted, the fee listed in the University's Fees Schedule will be payable.\nMore information on tuition fees and the University's fees schedule can be found here:\nStudent fees and finance\n(a)\nApplications for an extension to the Thesis-pending period should be submitted to a Student Service Centre or equivalent for consideration on behalf of the University, using the application form available from here.\nThesis-pending period (including Policy on extension)\n(b)\nOther than in exceptional circumstances applications will only be considered if received by a Student Service Centre no less than 3 months in advance of the Thesis-pending period.\n(c)\nAll applications require the support of the student's School.\nAll applications should include a plan detailing:\nwhich thesis chapters are complete\nwhat work remains to be done on incomplete chapters\na time-line for the completion of outstanding work and a date for submission of the completed thesis.\n17.\nAcceptable and unacceptable circumstances:\nThe following circumstances may result in an extension being granted:\nExceptional personal circumstances (e.g. illness, hospitalisation, accident) if significantly impacting on the writing-up process (or resubmission/minor corrections process relating to paragraph 37 below)\nMaternity\nPaternity\nDeath of a close relative, or illness of a close relative where the student is the carer\nIllness or death of a partner\nProlonged jury service\nExpeditions for sport of national significance (providing the extension is acceptable to the student’s funding body)\nRequirement for a student to undertake military service.\nThe following are examples of circumstances which would not normally warrant an extension:\nTaking up employment during the Thesis-pending period or resubmission/minor corrections process relating to paragraph 37 (of the Extension to a resubmission period or of time allowed for minor corrections section below)\nvoluntary service overseas.\nSubmission of thesis\nIncludes:\nafter registered study and before conclusion of Thesis-pending period; notification of submission; soft bound copies and electronic versions of thesis; role of proof readers; alternative formats for thesis submission; key documents\n18.\nStudents are required to submit a thesis for examination after their period of registered study and before the conclusion of the Thesis-pending period. A student must give formal notice to their School of their intention to submit their thesis. The School should ensure that a Student Service Centre or equivalent office is informed so that the procedure for appointing examiners can be initiated.\nThesis Submission\n19.\nAn electronic version saved as a searchable PDF, should be submitted to a Student Services or equivalent in a form prescribed by the University, which will forward the thesis to the Examiners. Soft bound copies may be required. PGRs are encouraged to publish papers in advance of submission of their thesis and prior publication of papers arising from the research being undertaken should not prejudice the assessment of the thesis.\n20.\nThe thesis must be written by the student and be the result of the student’s own work. It must be the result of work done mainly while the student is registered as a student of this University. This requirement does not preclude a student obtaining limited assistance with proof-reading and with the routine collection and/or processing of data under guidelines and instructions clearly devised by the student. When such help is obtained it should be with the prior approval of the supervisor who must be satisfied that the spirit of the 'own work' requirement is not breached.\nThe Role of Proofreaders\nA proofreader may only ensure that the meaning of the author is not misrepresented due to the quality and standard of the English used. This can include correcting spelling and basic grammar errors. Inaccuracies in academic content should not be corrected nor should the structure of the piece of work be changed; doing so may result in a charge of plagiarism.\nAt UNM, generally, a thesis should have a minimum of 10,000 words. The Senate or the equivalent authority in the University can use its discretion in cases where a thesis does not comply with the word limit but meets all other requirements.\n21.\nThe thesis should not be more than 100,000 words in the case of PhD or 60,000 words in the case of MPhil (in both cases inclusive of appendices, footnotes, tables, and bibliography); the University may withhold from examination a thesis that exceeds these word limits.\n22.\nAlternative formats for submission may apply. For certain doctorates (Music, Creative Writing, Drama and Performance Practice as Research, Translation Studies) an appendix detailing submission requirements is available. For more information, please consult the following:\nAlternative formats for thesis submission\nSubmission by Published Works may also be permitted.\nSubmission for research degree by published works\n23.\nStudents may offer performance work for assessment alongside the thesis as supplementary evidence for the ideas and arguments put forward in written form. Where such evidence is submitted, a permanent record of that evidence should be included with the version of the thesis that is lodged in the University Library.\n24.\nIf a thesis includes work which is politically, commercially or industrially sensitive, the student’s School may apply to the University for access to the thesis in the University libraries to be restricted. The restriction may be for a period not exceeding two years in the first instance with the possibility of an extension of that period up to a maximum of five years.\nMore information on the assessment of research students can be found here:\nAssessment\n25.\nIn circumstances where it is appropriate to the student’s discipline, students are required to submit all data collected during the period of study as a research student of this University to their School prior to arrangement of the viva voce examination. Failure to do so may mean that the thesis is withheld from examination.\nExamination\nIncludes:\nexaminer submission of independent report; viva voce examination; alternative forms of examination; attendance\n26.\nThe Examiners should submit independent reports on the thesis to a Student Service Centre or equivalent or the Head of School before the viva voce examination takes place. The reports should contain a full and frank assessment of the merits and weaknesses of the thesis. In the case of MPhil students, the reports should indicate whether a viva voce examination is necessary. If it is found not to be necessary, the Examiners should provide a recommendation as set out in Regulation 35 of the Outcomes of Examinations section on a Joint Report Form.\nMore information on Examiners can be found here:\nRole and appointment of Examiners\n27.\nThe School should seek to ensure that the viva voce examination takes place within 3 months of the submission of the thesis. The viva voce examination will normally take place at the University and in person. However, the Head of School or delegate may give permission in appropriate circumstances for the viva voce examination to be held in another location or through digital means, provided agreement of the Examiners and the student is obtained and the proposed location/format is one that is deemed by them all to be suitable for the purpose. The Head of School or delegate will confirm that the necessary conditions for a remote or online viva have been met when signing the Nomination of PGR Examiners form.\nGuidance and recommendations on the conduct of a digital/online viva voce examination\n28.\nIf circumstances allow or demand it, a viva voce examination may be organised in another form (e.g. by video conference/other online platform). Before agreeing such an arrangement the School must check that appropriate facilities for an online viva voce examination are available to all participants, and shall ensure they have written confirmation that the student and the Examiners have agreed to the proposal.\nGuidance and recommendations on the conduct of a digital/online viva voce examination\nHybrid viva conditions, with some participants together and some remotely situated, should be avoided where possible. If this format is required, if and where possible, the candidate should be co-located with either the Internal Examiner or Independent Chair. Vivas with only the candidate located remotely are not permitted. If an online format of the viva voce is agreed by all parties, this cannot subsequently be used as grounds for a appeal. No evidence based on recordings of the viva will be permissible in any appeal process.\n29.\nAn Independent Chair is not a requirement for a viva voce examination unless specific circumstances apply, such as conducting the viva online. The candidate or Head of School may request the appointment of an Independent Chair. An independent, non-examining chair must be appointed to preside over proceedings when specific circumstances apply, including at the request of the PGR.\nCircumstances under which an Independent Chair should be appointed\nIf the PGR requests an Independent Chair on grounds of equality and diversity, they may also request that the appointment takes the diversity of the examining team into consideration.\nWhen appointed, the Independent Chair will lead the viva, be present throughout and will provide a short report on the conduct of the viva. They will not take an active role in the examination or decision making other than supporting examiners to reach a decision with reference to the University of Nottingham Qualifications Framework/ QAA Framework for Higher Education Qualifications Award Descriptors.\nWhere the appointment of an Independent Chair is not required or requested, Schools should find alternative ways of assuring fairness and consistency which are acceptable to the student.\nCircumstances under which an Independent Chair should be appointed\nAppointment, role and responsibilities of the Independent Chair\n30.\nThe Head of School has a right to attend the viva voce examination of any research student in their School, as an observer, unless they are the student's supervisor when a deputy may be appointed to attend in their place. Before the viva voce examination takes place the Head of School should first inform the Examiners, the Independent Chair (if appointed) and the PGR that they wish to attend. The Examiners may request that the Head of School attend a viva voce examination.\nSupervisors may not attend the viva voce examination. If concerns about process or PGR support or performance are raised, an Independent Chair or the Head of School should attend.\nIf the viva voce is held online, the candidate may request that they have a supporter/observer present with them either for the entire viva or for the communication of the decision. This individual must not contribute to or participate in the viva in any way and must be introduced to all participants on camera at the start.\n31.\nThe viva will include questions and discussions that determine whether the candidate has achieved the required doctoral outcomes.\nFor more information about the UNQF, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\nThis will normally include questions and discussion designed to ascertain that the thesis embodies the candidate’s own research; clarify aspects of the research presented in the thesis to ensure understanding; test the candidate’s general comprehension of the field of study within which the subject of the thesis falls; test the candidate’s acquaintance with the general literature of the subject, and knowledge of the relation of the work to the wider field of which it is a part; and determine the respects in which the work advances, modifies, or otherwise affects the wider field of scholarship.\nOutcomes of Examination\nIncludes:\ncompletion of joint report form; frameworks; possible outcomes; resubmission; successful candidates\n32.\nFollowing the viva voce examination the Examiners should complete and sign the joint report form and come to agreement of the recommendation on the award (or not) of the degree. The student should be given immediate informal feedback on the recommended outcome of the examination and should be advised that more formal details will be transmitted later in writing. If the Examiners recommend that the degree should not be awarded and/or that the student should also be required to resubmit for the same or a different degree, the student should be provided with copies of the Examiners' reports. The Internal Examiner should also write to the student formally conveying the joint views of the Examiners on the submission, describing in detail the academic and presentational reasons for their recommendation, and (if appropriate) providing clear advice about what matters should be addressed in any resubmission.\n33.\nResearch degrees will be awarded at Masters or Doctoral level to students who have demonstrated that they satisfy the relevant qualification descriptors contained in the University of Nottingham Qualifications Framework (UNQF). For more information about the UNQF, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\n34.\nThe Examiners may recommend to the University the following outcomes of examination:\nAward of degree for which the student is registered, or\nAward of the degree subject to correction of typographical errors within one month\nAward of the degree subject to minor amendments to be completed within 3 months*, or\nRequire the candidate to attend a second viva voce examination and resubmit the same thesis (which may be subject to minor amendments to be completed within 3 months*), or\nResubmit the thesis in a revised form within 12 months with/without attending a second viva voce examination, or\nThat no degree be awarded and that the candidate is not allowed to present themself again for examination for the degree for which the thesis was submitted.\n35.\nWhere a thesis has been resubmitted and/or a second viva voce examination has occurred, the Examiners may recommend to the University the following outcomes of examination:\nAward of degree for which the student is registered, or\nAward of the degree subject to correction of typographical errors within one month, or\nAward of the degree with minor amendments to be completed within 3 months to the satisfaction of the internal examiner*, or\n(in the case of PhD students) Award of degree of MPhil without further conditions, or\n(in the case of PhD students) Award of the degree of MPhil with minor amendments to be completed within 3 months*\nNo degree awarded and no further examination opportunity.\n* Exceptionally, where a student has been previously registered as a part-time student and it has been demonstrated that circumstances exist such that it would be in the best interests of that student, the examiners may recommend that the degree be awarded subject to minor amendments being completed within 6 months.\n36.\nThe joint report form is forwarded by the Examiners to the Head of School and they shall forward the independent and joint report forms to a Student Service Centre for approval by the University. The Student Service Centre or equivalent will inform the student of the University's decision.\n37.\nSuccessful candidates will be eligible to graduate once their thesis has been uploaded to the University’s etheses service and approved by the Internal Examiner or, in cases where there are two External Examiners, the lead External Examiner.\nExtension to a resubmission period or of time allowed for minor corrections\n38.\nIn exceptional circumstances an extension to the resubmission period or of time allowed for minor corrections may be granted using the procedure in paragraphs 15-16 in the Thesis-pending period section above. Regular supervisory meeting should continue to take place as outlined in paragraph 15 of these regulations.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nGraduate School - PGR\nGS-PGR@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n06 February 2025||"

Although primarily directed at students, this information may also be of interest to staff across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Please note that students in the UK on a Student Route visa are also affected by the University's Policy on Immigration Sponsorship. Where academic policies and immigration policies seem to be contradictory, immigration policies will take precedence. For more information, please consult the following:\nImmigration sponsorship\nOverview and form requirements\nIncludes:\noptions; request to transfer taught course form; responsibilities\n1.1\nStudents may request to change from the course on which they are currently registered to another course offered by the University. They may either:\nChange to the same stage of the new course as they were at on the old course (for example, completing the Qualifying Year of the old course and then beginning Part I of the new course); or\nThey may\ngo back one stage (for example, leaving the old course towards the end of the Qualifying Year and beginning the new course from the very start of the Qualifying Year).\n1.2\nApplicable to all Campuses\nIn all cases, the School that the student is leaving must be aware of the student's request and the school that the student is joining\nmust agree to the change. Not all courses offer the opportunity for transfer on to them, and students must follow the guidance below to see which courses may be available.\nUNUK only\nStudents should check the following lists to determine course availability for an internal transfer:\nFaculty of Arts\nFaculty of Engineering\nFaculty of Medicine and Health Sciences\nFaculty of Science\nFaculty of Social Science\nUNNC only\nStudents should refer to the Academic Services Office page on Moodle to determine course availability for internal transfer:\nAcademic Services Office\nUNM only\nStudents should confirm course availability with the relevant school.\nApplicable to all Campuses\nFor all transfers, students must meet the entry criteria for the course. Students must check that they meet the entry criteria on the online course catalogue before requesting a transfer.\nOnline course catalogue\nA change of course form should be completed indicating the support of both Schools.\nRequest to transfer taught course form\nIn some cases, the agreement of the Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) to the change of course is also required. The ability to change course may also be subject to the student's immigration status. In the case of Joint Honours or major/minor courses, the administering School accepting or giving up a student should inform its partner School of the change.\n1.3\nThere is no requirement on Schools to agree to a request for a course change, and Schools are free to turn down such requests.\n1.4\nContent in this policy referring to ‘students’ applies equally to apprentices unless otherwise stated. Apprentices considering a change of taught course are required to discuss the matter immediately with their employer and their School. There are implications to their current employment contract, their apprenticeship commitment statement and thus contractual arrangement with the University of Nottingham. If considering moving to a non-apprenticeship programme, the apprentice should note they would become personably responsible for their tuition fees whether as part time or full time student.\nIt is the responsibility of the student to determine whether there will be any difference in tuition fees as a result of the change of course and to check with their funding body whether the change will have any other financial implications.\nChange of undergraduate course without going back a stage\nIncludes:\ntime limits; transfer criteria\n2.1\nAll changes of course without going back a stage can only occur in the first three weeks of the session, or at the end of the Autumn semester, or at the end of the session (unless module choices for the old course satisfy those for the new course and so no change in module selection is required).\n2.2\nWhere a student wishes to transfer at the end of the Autumn or Spring semester of the Qualifying Year without restarting the new course, the school responsible for the student's new course must be satisfied that the student has the necessary prerequisite knowledge to be able to perform adequately on that course.\n2.3\nWhere a student wishes to transfer after the start of Part I without going back to the beginning of Part I of the new course, one of the following criteria must be met:\nThe change is agreed in the first three weeks of Part I; or\nThe change is to a related course, and the student has already taken all the Part I/II/III modules which they should have taken by this point in the new course; or\nThe student has not taken some or all of the Part I/II/III modules they should have taken by this point in the new course, but they will catch up by taking these modules at a later stage in their new course in place of options (in a manner which the School being joined must indicate in writing to accompany the change of course form); or\nThe student has not taken some or all of the Part I/II/III modules they should have taken by this point in the new course, but the supplementary regulations for that course allow the School to waive the need to take those modules.\n2.4\nIf none of the criteria in 2.3 are met, but the School still wishes to recommend a change of course without going back to the start of Part I, a case\nshould be made for consideration on behalf of Quality and Standards Committee (QSC). The case should demonstrate that the student has already substantially achieved the learning outcomes of the modules they have missed, or will be able to do so during the rest of their new course.\n2.5\nIf the change is made at the end of the Autumn semester, the marks from the old course will be used for progression and degree classification purposes along with the Spring semester marks from the new course (the Part I/II/III weightings for degree classification purposes will, however, be those for the new course). If a year-long module was being taken on the old course, the relevant School should be asked to allocate a mark for the Autumn semester element of the module on the basis of performance during that semester (which may mean placing a semester-long version of the module on relevant systems for this purpose).\n2.6\nIf the change is made at the end of the session, it will be necessary for the student to be in a position to progress under University regulations (though not necessarily supplementary regulations) to the next stage of the old course before being allowed to begin the next year of the new course,\nPlease note that to transfer to another honours course, it is necessary to be able to progress to the next stage of the old honours (not ordinary) degree course.\nChange of undergraduate course that includes going back part of a stage or more\nIncludes:\nstudents who are progressing satisfactorily who choose to request a transfer of course; students who cannot progress on their original course and wish to transfer to another course\nStudents who are progressing satisfactorily who choose to request a transfer of course\n3.1\nSchools may, if they wish, agree to accept students who submit a request to leave their old course at whatever stage they have reached and begin their new course from scratch, so long as the student meets the normal admission requirements for the new course.\n3.2\nSchools may also accept students who are in or at the end of Part I, or in Part II or III, of their old course and wish to start their new course from the beginning of Part I. Schools must, though, be satisfied that the student has the necessary prerequisite knowledge to be able to perform adequately on the new course.\n3.3\nStudents in Part II or III of their course wishing to transfer to a new course from the beginning of Parts II or III respectively must be able to\nsatisfy one of the criteria listed in 2.3 (of the previous section) or the school must provide a case as specified in 2.4 (of the previous section).\n3.4\nIn choosing options, students changing course must not select modules which they have previously taken. Where the range of options stipulated by supplementary regulations is so limited as to make this impossible, the arrangements set out in 3.5 will apply.\n3.5\nIn certain cases, supplementary regulations for a student's new course contain compulsory modules which the student has already taken. In these circumstances, the school may decide either:\n(a)\nthat the module(s) should be\ntaken again, in which case the mark gained at the first attempt (that is, on the previous course) will be the one used for degree classification purposes and the higher of the two marks gained used for progression purposes, or;\n(b)\nthat the student should be registered on agreed modules rather than repeating enrolments on compulsory modules that have been successfully completed. Where (b) applies the compulsory modules will be included in the degree classification and the additional modules will not contribute to the degree award.\n3.6\n(i)\nA change of course\ninvolving going back one or more stages can take place at any time in the session. Students can either choose to complete the session on their old course or suspend their registration for the rest of the session. If the session is completed, there is no need for the student to be in a position to progress in order to change course if going back one or more stages.\n(ii)\nSchools may not, though, accept such a student if the compulsory modules on the student's proposed new course include more than 60 credits that the student has already studied.\nStudents who cannot progress on their original course and wish to transfer to another course\n3.7\nA student who cannot progress after having one reassessment opportunity (including where the student's course has been terminated) may be allowed to change course (going back one or more stages), with the agreement of the schools involved, rather than be required to withdraw from the University. Schools may not, though, accept such a student if the compulsory modules on the student's proposed new course include\nmore than 60 credits that the student took on the course from which they could not progress.\n3.8\nWhere supplementary regulations for a student's new course contain any compulsory modules which the student has already taken, the module(s) should be taken again and the higher of the two marks gained used for progression purposes. The mark gained at the first attempt (that is, on the previous course) will, though, be the one used for degree classification purposes.\nChange from an undergraduate Foundation year to Honours programme\nIncludes:\nrequirements; request to transfer form; impact of student immigration status\nStudents on some Foundation programmes are required to choose the Honours programme they will transfer to if successful at the end of the foundation year. Where this applies, students will be advised when this choice must be made and are required to complete the ‘Request to Transfer Taught Course – Foundation Year to Honours Degree only’ form and return it to the Director of the Foundation Programme by the published deadline.\nRequest to transfer from a foundation taught course to an honours degree form\nFailure to do so may mean a student is unable to start an honours programme in the next academic year.\nThe ability to transfer to a selected course may be subject to the student’s immigration status.\nChange of a postgraduate taught course\nIncludes:\nrequirements; request to transfer taught course form; conditions of transfer\nWhere a postgraduate student on a taught course (PGT) wishes to transfer course, a change of course form (obtainable from Registry and Academic Affairs and below) should be completed by the student, obtaining written approval from the school(s) involved.\nRequest to transfer taught course form\nSuch a course transfer can only take place in the first three weeks of either the Autumn Semester or the Spring Semester. If the transfer is taking place in the Spring Semester, the school responsible for the student's new course must be satisfied that the student has the necessary prerequisite knowledge to be able to perform adequately on that course.\nIf either of these conditions is not met, the school will be required to make a case to Quality and Standards Committee (QSC).\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n21 May 2024||"

Its content is primarily directed at Senior Tutors but may also be of interest to other staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.1.0 Purpose\nThis page provides guidance on the role and responsibilities of a Senior Tutor.\n2.0 Key Principles\n2.1 Role and responsibilities of Senior Tutors\nSenior tutors are responsible for coordinating the following activities within their School or part thereof:\nOverseeing and coordinating the operation of student support and development and the personal tutoring system in their School or unit, as well as acting as a point of reference, advice and guidance for all personal tutors in their School or unit.\nProducing and annually updating guidance for personal tutors in their School or unit as a local supplement to the University Guidance for Personal Tutors, ensuring that all material is appropriately disseminated to all personal tutors within their School or unit.\nProviding appropriate information and training for personal tutors to enable them to fulfil their role effectively.\nAppropriate induction of new personal tutors.\nAppropriate refresher training for all personal tutors must be organised biennially (resources to provide such training are developed by working together with other Senior Tutors and shared by way of the Senior Tutor Network (STN))\nAssisting students in cases where the student feels unable to approach their designated personal tutor, including arranging allocation of a new personal tutor if necessary\nAdvising the Head of School or head of unit on the adequacy of tutor to student ratios, on any other matters relevant to the effectiveness of the School’s arrangements for personal tutoring, and on any matters related to student wellbeing and their impact upon learning\nReviewing all induction processes for new students to ensure their School or unit complies with its responsibilities in this area. The Senior Tutor needs to ensure that students are aware of the importance of participation in the personal tutoring programmes and the expectation to seek support as needed\nEnsuring that school or unit handbooks for staff and students are updated regularly about personal tutoring arrangements in their school or unit and about student support and development across the University\nLiaising closely with other colleagues who have responsibilities for specific aspects of support for students’ learning and development such as the School’s Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) for disability issues, the Support and Wellbeing Officers for student welfare issues, the School’s careers and employability staff links and the appropriate staff in the Student Service centres\nMonitoring and enhancing the effectiveness of student support and development and the personal tutor system in their school by a range of means, likely to include:\nbeing members of their School or unit teaching and learning committees and liaising with the specialist services;\ncollecting and responding to staff and student feedback (for example, through Student Staff Fora or equivalent (SSFs), or personal tutoring programme evaluations);\nAnnual evaluation of the personal tutoring programmes and providing a summary report to relevant people including the University Senior Tutor;\nbeing part of extenuating circumstance panels and examination boards;\nand consulting with colleagues in other Schools.\nSenior Tutors must review student participation in the personal tutor programme as part of their annual evaluation of personal tutoring and feedback\nEnsuring that student support, development and personal tutoring is an agenda item on all relevant school or unit committees, SSFs and education meetings\nDissemination of information from the STN to their School's personal tutors and other relevant colleagues and, if appropriate, to students\nEnsuring annual updating and submission of the School or unit’s tutoring statement to the University Senior Tutor and communication of such tutoring statements to staff and students (for example, by inclusion in appropriate staff and student handbooks, including on Moodle).\nNewly appointed Senior Tutors are expected to engage in training for new Senior Tutors which is organised annually, if required, by the University Senior Tutor.\n2.2 Senior Tutor Network\nAll Senior Tutors automatically become members of the University’s Senior Tutor Network (STN), which they are expected to attend and actively participate in.\nThe STN meetings take place at scheduled times throughout the year and help support and inform the Senior Tutors in their role, acting as a two-directional conduit for relevant information to and from the University Executive Board (UEB). International campus Senior Tutors liaise regularly with the University Senior Tutor and have access to the STN workspace.\nIn addition, one member of the STN will be appointed as the University Senior Tutor and one member will be appointed Deputy University Senior Tutor.\n3.0 Related Regulations, Policies and Procedures\nFor more information and resources, please consult the following:\nSenior Tutors Network - Workspace\nSenior Tutors Network - MS Teams\nSenior Tutor Network Membership List (Internal only)\n4.0 Version Control Table\nVersion Control Table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nReformatted to align with new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework based on content last modified on 21/06/2024\nQSC\nFebruary 2025\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n24 February 2025||"

        "content": "Policy on academic misconduct - The University of NottinghamPolicy on academic misconduct\nThis page contains the University's policy on academic misconduct. Its content is applicable to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Principles\nIncludes:\nacademic integrity; summative and formative assessments; scope; fitness to practise procedures; training and guidance; responsibilities; standard of proof extenuating circumstances; aggravating factors\n1.1\nThe academic activities at the University of Nottingham whether scholarship, research, or innovation are based on the values of academic integrity. Academic integrity is a set of values and practices that expect us to act with honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility.\n1.2\nAcademic misconduct is any inappropriate activity or behaviour by a student which may give that student, or another student, an unpermitted academic advantage in a summative assessment and is unacceptable within the University’s scholarly community. This includes activity or behaviour during preparation for a summative assessment even if there is no direct evidence of misconduct in the submitted assessment itself, e.g., approaching a third party for help during an examination even if there is no evidence of the material provided being used in the summative assessment. Such activities and behaviours will be considered under these regulations, and this may lead to a penalty being imposed.\nA summative assessment is an assessment that counts towards an award, a transcript mark, or a progression decision. This includes postgraduate research students’ annual reviews and thesis submissions.\nFormative assessment is primarily designed to give feedback on progress and inform development but do not contribute to a module mark. Instances that resemble academic misconduct in formative assessments should normally be addressed by specific and extensive feedback on the issue. This is to ensure change of behaviour and act as a preventative measure.\n1.3\nThese regulations are to be applied to all students of the University, whether currently registered or not. Former students will be subject to the academic misconduct regulations that were in place whilst they were a registered student.\n1.4\nThe University’s Fitness to Practise procedures may also be applied to students on programmes of study that lead to professional registration and whose actions are considered under these regulations. Findings of proven intent to commit academic misconduct (see 1.10 below) will also be referred for consideration under the relevant Fitness to Practise concerns process. For more information, please consult the following:\nFitness to practise procedures\n1.5\nSchools/Departments will provide advice and examples to students of what constitutes academic misconduct. They will inform students of these regulations and the possible outcomes of  academic misconduct. Students have a responsibility to undertake available training and read relevant guidance.\n1.6\nStudents must take responsibility for the integrity of their own work, including asking for clarification.\n1.7\nConfirmed instances of academic misconduct and any penalty  imposed may be referred to in student references relating to a student’s academic achievement at University. For some courses, the University must notify the relevant accrediting body. For more information, please consult the following:\nFitness to practise procedures\n1.8\nThe standard of proof is that of “the balance of probabilities”. Evidence indicating that, on the balance of probabilities, academic misconduct has occurred will be deemed sufficient for action under these regulations.\n1.9\nAlthough extenuating circumstances do not justify the occurrence of academic misconduct, such circumstances may be taken into account when determining an appropriate penalty. Students are responsible for ensuring that they inform the University of any extenuating circumstances that they consider are affecting their ability to undertake an assessment, to ensure appropriate support can be provided.\nStudents cannot use other procedures e.g., Extenuating Circumstances or Academic Appeals, to request an outcome that would change a penalty for academic misconduct.\n1.10\nIt is not necessary to prove intention to commit academic misconduct to make a finding of academic misconduct. However, proven intent to commit academic misconduct is likely to be considered an aggravating factor when determining a penalty. Examples of proven intent include, but are not limited to:\nFalse authorship or impersonation\nFalsifying data\nFalsifying content or evidence as part of an extenuating circumstances claim\nAccessing any unauthorised websites (including Moodle) during an examination\nTaking or accessing unauthorised, concealed, or pre-prepared materials into an examination and where the materials are potentially relevant to the examination.\nTypes of academic misconduct\nIncludes:\nplagiarism; false authorship; collusion; misconduct in examinations and in-person assessments; fabrication or misrepresentation\n2.1\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of academic misconduct which will be considered under these regulations:\n2.1.1   Plagiarism\nPlagiarism is representing work or ideas of a third party as one’s own. For example, by failing to correctly acknowledge others’ ideas and work as sources of information in a summative assessment. Plagiarism is not limited to text-based sources; it also applies to the use of graphical material, images, video/audio, calculations, etc.\nWhere permitted, a proof-reader may identify spelling and basic grammar errors. Inaccuracies in academic content must not be corrected nor should the structure of the piece of work be changed; doing so may result in a charge of plagiarism. A proof-reader may only be used to ensure that the work meets a quality threshold in accordance with the University’s Policy on Proofreading unless a School/Department policy specifically prohibits this. Students should make every effort to familiarise themselves with their School/Department’s policy as well as the University policy regarding proof-reading. Paraphrasing or re-ordering the words of plagiarised text to avoid Turnitin matches is plagiarism if the ideas are represented as the student’s own. Schools/Departments should ensure this information is accessible to students.\nFor more information about the Proofreading policy, please consult the following:\nProofreading policy\n2.1.2   False Authorship\nFalse Authorship is where a student is not the sole author of the work they have submitted as their own work. False Authorship is a form of plagiarism but is distinguished by the fact that the student has engaged with an unauthorised or unacknowledged third party and/or software tool to complete an assessment, either in part or whole.\nFalse Authorship can be direct or through a platform or software (such as Course Hero or similar). This may include work produced by another student, an essay mill, a family member or friend, or a tutoring service (such as Chegg, or similar). The use of answers advertised or provided by tutoring services or essay mills is false authorship. As it is the authorship of work that is contested, there is no requirement to prove that the work has been purchased.\nFalse Authorship also occurs where a student has engaged with computer-aided software to complete an assessment, in whole or part, except in cases where this has been permitted by an explicit instruction by the School and/or as part of that assessment. This engagement can be the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) software (e.g., ChatGPT, Wordtune, DALL-E, chatbots and similar). The submission of work that is generated and/or improved by software that is not permitted for that assessment, for the purpose of gaining marks will be regarded as false authorship and seen as an attempt to gain an unpermitted academic advantage. For clarity this includes the over-reliance  on translation and paraphrasing software (for example Grammarly), including when it is used to conceal the original author or source material. Students should familiarise themselves with the local policies on what is, and is not permitted. If a student is unsure about what is/is not permitted for an assessment, they are responsible for confirming this with their School.\n2.1.3   Collusion\nCollusion is cooperation in order to gain an unpermitted advantage. This may occur where students have  collaborated on a piece of work, in part or whole, and passed it off as their own individual efforts; where one student has authorised another to use their work, in part or whole, and to submit it as their own; or when a student has stolen somebody else’s work. A colluding student does not have to gain an unpermitted advantage in their own summative assessment for academic misconduct to have occurred.\nPermitted input from University tutors or approved readers or scribes is not considered to be collusion.\n2.1.4   Misconduct in examinations and in-person assessments\nMisconduct in examinations includes, for example, when an examination candidate:\nCopies from the examination script of another candidate.\nObtains or offers any other improper assistance from or to another candidate (or any other person unless an approved reader or scribe). This includes engagement with online tutoring services/essay mills even if the student does not go on to submit the work provided as part of the summative assessment.\nAllows themself to be impersonated or when any person impersonates another examination candidate. This definition is not limited to formal examinations and includes presentations, group work and other forms of summative assessment.\nHas with them any unauthorised materials, including mathematical tables manuscripts or loose papers of any kind, unauthorised electronic devices (e.g., mobile telephones, smart watches) or any source of unauthorised information.\nIt is the student’s responsibility to ensure unauthorised items are not taken into an examination. It is not the responsibility of the invigilator to search for and remove the unauthorised items.\nWhere a student is found to have taken unauthorised materials or an electronic device into an exam setting or a location that can be accessed during the exam, the student is guilty of academic misconduct, irrespective of that student’s intent or the nature of the materials.\n2.1.5   Fabrication or misrepresentation\nFabrication or misrepresentation is the presentation or misrepresentation of fabricated data, results, references, evidence, or other material, including, for example:\nClaiming to have carried out experiments, observations, interviews, or other forms of research which a student has not, in fact, carried out;\nFalsely claiming to have obtained results or other evidence;\nIn the case of professional qualifications, falsely claiming to have completed hours in practice or to have achieved required competencies when this is not the case;\nSubmitting a false Extenuating Circumstances claim where the facts of the claim and/or evidence has been fabricated/falsified. This activity will be addressed as academic misconduct even if the claim is not approved.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nPolicy on minimum English language entry requirements\nAdmissions\n2.1.6\nFailure to disclose previous experience or qualifications that are a bar to enrolment on a module (for example, enrolment on inter-faculty language modules).\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nLanguage Centre module enrolment\n2.1.7\nFailure to obtain ethical approval: where work is undertaken without obtaining ethical approval when there is a clear and unambiguous requirement to do so. This may be specified, for example, in module handbooks or in University research ethics policies.\n2.1.8   Poor Academic Scholarship\nPoor academic scholarship is conduct which breaches the standard of academic integrity expected by the University and which does not neatly fit into the definitions outlined above. Such behaviour could include; the mishandling and inappropriate use of research data and the uploading of information (including live assessment material and criteria) onto a public forum.\nRecycling\n3.1   Recycling (self-plagiarism)\nThe multiple submission by a student of their own material (either in whole or in part) is not considered academic misconduct. This includes work that the student may have submitted for a previous academic year, for another course or at a different institution. Submission of material that has been submitted on a previous occasion for a different summative assessment is, however, unlikely to be academically appropriate. The merit of such material will therefore be a matter of academic judgement.\nDeclaration of Falsified and/or Counterfeit Qualification\n4.1   Declaration of Falsified and/or Counterfeit Qualification\nDeclaration of falsified and/or counterfeit qualification is where a student has declared a  qualification which has later been found to be counterfeit or fraudulently gained and affects the student’s suitability to study for their qualification at the University.  Such behaviour may be found during the process of investigating an allegation of academic misconduct.  If this is the case the student may be refered to to the University Disciplinary procedure:\nFor more information about the University Disciplinary procedure, please consult the following:\nUniversity Disciplinary procedure\nRelated links and documentation\nIncludes:\nCode of ethical research conduct and research ethics; Policy on communications with third parties; Unacceptable behaviour policy; further guidance about procedures and exam conditions\nFor more information about related codes and policies, please consult the following:\nCode of Research Conduct and Research Ethics\nCode of Practice on Handling Allegations of Research Misconduct\nStudent Services - Policy on Communications with Third Parties\nStudent Services - Unacceptable behaviour policy\nFurther guidance about procedures and exam conditions\nFor more information about the academic misconduct procedure and exam conditions, please consult the following:\nStudent Services - Academic misconduct procedure\nStudent Services - In-person examinations\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please email:\nacademic-misconduct@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n27 February 2025||"

        "content": "Responsibilities of the supervisor - The University of NottinghamResponsibilities of the supervisor\nThis page contains detailed information about the role and responsibilities of a postgraduate supervisor, including research planning and thesis requirements. Its content is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Please be aware that due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, some of the content on this page has been amended as part of the University's mitigation efforts. Where this applies, it will be clearly indicated within each section below.\nNote:\nIn addition to the responsibilities detailed in this section, Postgraduate Student Advisors should also see the additional Covid-19 related responsibilities for Heads of Schools, PGR Directors and Supervisors for 2020-21. For more information, please consult the following:\nResponsibilities of the Head of School, Supervisor and Director of PGR Programme - Additional guidance for the 2020-21 academic year in response to Covid-19\n1. Policy\nSupervisors will provide guidance and assistance to PGRs so that they may carry out their research and present their results to the best advantage.\nEvery supervisor and every PGR will be provided with guidance on their respective roles and responsibilities.\n2. Role of the supervisor\nThe general role of supervisors is to guide and assist PGRs until submission of their thesis and any subsequent period of corrections, until such a point that examiners have reached a final decision on the award of the degree. The roles of supervisor and examiner are quite distinct, and it is not one of the roles of the supervisor to assess the thesis.\nThe specific roles of supervisors may differ depending on the academic discipline, Departmental practice and whether the member of staff is acting as lead, second, assistant, temporary or permanent supervisor. The lead supervisor (or delegate) will also consider requests for annual leave in line with School/Departmental policy.\n3. Role of the assistant supervisor\nMany postdoctoral research staff, level 4 Research Officers and research technicians make valuable contributions towards the supervision of the University’s PGRs.\nThe formal appointment of such staff as assistant supervisors as part of a supervisory team is intended to recognise and acknowledge this contribution and to identify the roles and responsibilities of assistant supervisors in order that this is clear to the candidate and all members of the supervisory team.\nAssistant supervisors are responsible for:\nproviding regular support and advice to PGRs. This may include guidance on welfare matters and health and safety.\nproviding guidance on how to use equipment or specific research techniques and methods.\nhelping PGRs to resolve difficulties they encounter and/or direct them to others who can assist.\nproviding PGRs with informal feedback on their written work and/or presentations.\nwhere applicable, contributing to the reporting of progress of PGRs, noting that the level of involvement with this will be agreed, in advance, with the lead and co-supervisor(s).\nencouraging PGRs to disseminate their research.\nengaging with professional development opportunities to develop their supervisory practice including any mandatory training requirements.\nensuring they are familiar with policies and processes applicable to research degrees.\n4. Continuing professional development\nAll supervisors must undertake continuing professional development, so that their work as a supervisor is supported.\nSupervisors should take the initiative in updating their knowledge and skills by participating in a range of appropriate activities and sharing good practice.\nMore information on support for research supervisors can be found here:\nResearcher Academy\n5. Documentation check\nIncludes:\nresponsibilities\nAt the outset the supervisor should check that the candidate has received information sent by the University concerning registration and that they have registered for that session.\nBefore or at initial registration or, at the latest within 4 weeks of initial registration, supervisors should check that all their PGRs have received copies of essential documentation relevant to their research studies or have been informed about where to locate them on the web. As a minimum, this should include: information about registration and services, the School Handbook, and any relevant safety advice.\nFor more information about registration, please consult the following:\nStudent Services - registration\n6. Research plan\nIncludes:\nassistance; designing a programme of research; for full-time doctoral students\nSupervisors will assist their PGRs to plan their research studies, including helping them to define their research topic; to identify schemes and specific tasks; to identify the relevant research literature, databases and other relevant sources, and to be aware of the standards in the discipline.\nThe supervisor and candidate should design a programme of research in which (subject to research progress and taking into account special cases) all or much of the thesis will have been written up by the candidate by the end of their period of registered study. The design of the programme of research should not at the outset plan to include any period of thesis pending that the candidate is entitled to.\nFor full-time doctoral candidates on a 3 year programme, it is expected that the completion of the entire doctoral examination process is completed within 4 years. The PGR may need to register for some taught modules or attend research training courses. The supervisor will advise them how to do this.\nNote:\nWhere the PGR's research has been impacted as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the supervisor should help the PGR to adjust their plan and research design and advise them on how the impacts may be mitigated.\n7. Advising on regulations\nIncludes:\nunderstanding and knowledge; responsibilities\nSupervisors should have a reasonable knowledge and understanding of the University's regulations governing research study and the University, Faculty and Departmental procedures governing research study and supervision.\nThey are required to advise their PGRs on these regulations and procedures or, if they feel a question is outside their knowledge, to direct their PGR to other sources such as Student Services (or Central Administration at UNM and the Graduate School at UNNC).\nSupervisors also have a responsibility to ensure that other members of the supervisory team are kept informed of the candidate’s progress, and any issues which may be having an impact on their programme.\n8. Advising on services and facilities\nIncludes:\nresponsibilities; review of PGR needs\nSupervisors should have a reasonable knowledge of and be able to advise their PGRs on the availability of the University's academic services and facilities (for example library and computing facilities) and how to make use of them.\nThe supervisors in conjunction with the PGR should keep under review the facilities which are required in order to carry out the research and make these needs known to the Head of School.\n9. Minimum number of supervisions\nIncludes:\nresponsibility to provide appropriate and regular supervision; requirements for part-time PGRs\nSupervisors are responsible for providing appropriate and regular supervision for their PGRs until submission of their thesis and any subsequent period of corrections, until such a point that examiners have reached a final decision on the award of the degree. They are also responsible for being accessible at mutually convenient times to listen and offer advice.\nStudents and supervisors are jointly responsible for arranging the supervision meetings.\nSupervisors must provide their part-time candidates with a minimum of 6 recorded supervisions a year and their full-time candidates with a minimum of 12 recorded supervisions a year.\nThese supervisory meetings must be at least monthly for full time candidates and two-monthly for part time candidates. This is based on calendar months. Note, it is expected that in many cases the actual number of meetings between supervisors and candidates may exceed these minima.\nIf it is not possible for a meeting to take place as scheduled, the meeting should be re-arranged for the next available opportunity.\nIf no meetings are possible in any given month (or two months for part time students), the supervisor is responsible to ensure that the reason for the missed meeting is recorded appropriately. These reports should be regularly monitored by the School. University staff will review the missed meeting reports on a case by case basis, particularly for PGRs are at risk of breaching visa and immigration requirements, to see if any additional support is required. These requirements may also be modified under the rules for supervising students working off-site.\nFor students who are missing meetings, or who are not meeting the meeting minima requirements, the regulations governing attendance and engagement should be reviewed:\nUNUK regulations governing attendance and engagement\nUNNC and UNM\nregulations governing attendance and engagement\n10. Format for supervisions\nIncludes:\ndefinition; purpose\nA 'supervision meeting' is considered to be a any simultaneous contact between the supervisor(s) and PGR candidate for an academic purpose. It is important that at the supervision meetings the PGR’s progress to date and/or the future direction of their research or thesis writing is discussed. It is also necessary that these discussions must be summarised in writing so that they are available if required, for example for audit purposes, or to aid student wellbeing or support. These written reports must meet the minimum number requirements as detailed earlier.\nThere is no specified format for these meetings.  For example, a daily chat at the lab bench and/or a pre-scheduled sit down meeting would meet these criteria, as long as a monthly report with a progress overview is still submitted. Group meetings of PGRs and/or seminars would be acceptable as long as the PGR’s progress to date and/or the future direction of their research or thesis writing is discussed.\nA supervision meeting should typically take place as a face-to-face meeting, but can also include meetings conducted online, such as on Microsoft Teams. The exception to this is where the PGR is in the UK on a student visa, unless the student has been given formal permission to study at a different location, supervision meetings must be face-to-face and on campus.\n11. Supervision record\nIncludes:\nreporting needs; annual review of PGRs\nIn order that proper audit of supervision provision can be carried out, so that supervisors may undertake continuous monitoring of their PGR’s progress, and records of this progress monitoring are available for formal Progression Review, supervisors are required to ensure the maintenance of a supervision record of at least the minimum number and frequency of supervision meetings a year (see Section 9 above).\nSupervisors should advise their PGRs on the procedures for monitoring their progress which are described in the section of this Quality Manual entitled Progression Review of research students.\nThese include:\n(i)\nSupervision Records - attendance at supervision sessions and completion of supervision records;\n(ii)\nProgression Review - formal review of progress towards meeting the required outcomes, and assessment of whether the outcomes will be met in the required time. Completion of the Progression Review forms.\n(iii)\nMPhil and doctoral registration - procedures for upgrading or downgrading candidates and for confirming MPhil or doctoral registration.\nSupervisors may, from time to time, be required to provide reports on their PGR’s progress for other purposes and to other agencies, for example, the Research Councils and other sponsors. Such reports should be provided within the required deadline to ensure, in particular, that the continuation of candidate’s funding by outside agencies is not compromised.\nFor more information about the Progression Review of research students, please consult the following:\nProgression Review of research students\n12. Training needs\nIncludes:\ndiscussing personal, academic, and professional skills; PGR training programme; research ethics; Code of research conduct and research ethics\nThe supervisor should discuss with the PGR what personal, academic, and professional skills training they require in order to complete their research degree and to provide a skills base for a future career.\nThe supervisor should agree with the candidate a research training programme which is compatible with the PGR's needs and which is achievable in relation to the research commitments within the limits of their registered period of study, making it clear where attendance at training courses is compulsory or voluntary. This programme should be reviewed each year.\nThe supervisors should take reasonable steps to ensure that the PGR’s training needs are met. Normally such training will be delivered within the University and the supervisor should, therefore, be aware of any research training offered through the Researcher Academy, the Doctoral Training Centre/Programme, the Faculty and the School.\nThe supervisor should also ensure that the PGR receives adequate training in research ethics and is given assistance in applying for ethical approval if appropriate.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nCode of research conduct and research ethics\nResearcher Academy\n13. Safety\nIncludes:\ncorrect procedures; seeking advice\nThe supervisor(s) should be aware of and advise the PGR of the correct safety procedures pertaining to their research and, if in doubt, should seek advice from the Head of School, School Safety Officer, University Safety Office or University of Malaysia (UNM)/University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC) Safety Committee as appropriate.\n14. Meetings, conferences and publication\nThe supervisor(s) should encourage and facilitate the PGR to engage with relevant academics who will support their doctoral research and future career development.\nThis could be through encouraging attendance at seminars, meetings and conferences; introducing them to relevant individuals and professional networks; and encouraging them to publish the results of their research.\nWhere appropriate supervisors should also support the PGRs to participate in public and policy engagement activities or undertake placements and internships that will enable them to develop their broader research experiences.\n15. Written work\nThe supervisor should request written work as appropriate, and read and provide constructive criticism on it within a reasonable time.\n16. Supervision during thesis pending period\nIncludes:\nminimum number of meetings; the role of proofreaders\nDuring the thesis pending period and any period of corrections or thesis re-submission, supervisors and PGRs should continue to meet regularly (as described above).\nSupervisors will also read and comment on one draft of the candidate’s thesis prior to each submission (as appropriate) when submitted within the required timeframes for feedback to be given.\nThe Role of Proofreaders\nA proofreader may only ensure that the meaning of the author is not misrepresented due to the quality and standard of the English used. This can include correcting spelling and basic grammar errors.\nInaccuracies in academic content should not be corrected nor should the structure of the piece of work be changed; doing so may result in a charge of plagiarism.\n17. Thesis presentation\nSupervisors should advise candidate’s on the timing, construction and form of presentation of their thesis and should check that they receive a copy of the University's guidance on presenting a thesis, from Student Services or Central Administration at UNM or Graduate School at UNNC.\n18. Examination of thesis\nThe supervisor is responsible for advising the Internal Examiner whether the electronic version of the thesis can be shared with the External Examiner.\n19. Submission of data\nSupervisors should ensure that, in circumstances where it is appropriate to the discipline, the PGR is aware of the requirement to submit all data collected during the period of study as a PGR of this University, to their School prior to arrangement of the viva voce examination.\nAdditional information\nIncludes:\nPGR supervision record; Research supervisor resources\nFor each of these sessions a Supervision Record must be completed.\nPGR supervision record\nPGR supervision record\nResearch supervisor resources\nStudents studying in outside organisations\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nGraduate School - PGR\nGS-PGR@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n10 July 2024||"

Its content is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Please be aware that during academic year 2019/20, the University introduced exceptional regulations in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. These were campus specific and meant to be read in conjunction with all pre-existing content.\nFrom the beginning of academic year 2021/22, the active application of the exceptional regulations affecting this page has now ceased, with the sole exception of those which cover extenuating circumstances at the University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM). The following will remain active at UNM until further notice in light of the current situation in Malaysia:\nCovid-19 EC Exceptional Regulations - UNM\nAny outcomes from the application of the regulations during academic years 2019/20 and 2020/21 across all three campuses will, however, continue to be honoured and used in all decisions regarding those affected.\nFurther details about those regulations which have NOT been extended into academic year 2021/22 can be found in the \"Exceptional regulations applied in response to Covid-19\" section below.\nPlease be aware that due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, some of the content on this page has also been amended as part of the University's mitigation efforts. Where this applies, it will be clearly indicated within each section below.\n1. Scope of policy\nThis policy only applies to students on doctoral level and Master of Philosophy degrees who are eligible for a Thesis-pending period.\nStudents on 1 year research degrees (for example, Master of Research) do not have a Thesis-pending period.\n2. Entitlements in the Thesis-pending period\nIncludes:\nfacilities; meetings with supervisors\nStudents who have completed their research and the period of registered study as required by regulations may enter the Thesis-pending period.\nIn this period of 12 months (for students who were registered full-time) or 24 months (for students who were registered part-time) or less, the student will be entitled to the use of library facilities and University computing facilities but not to facilities for research.\nThe PGR and supervisors should continue to meet regularly, in line with supervisor meeting requirements.\nPGR Responsibilities of the supervisor\nFor avoidance of doubt, supervisory meetings should continue throughout the Thesis-pending period to support the PGR student to reach the point of final thesis submission in a timely way and minimise any extensions to registration.\nSupervisors will read and comment on one draft of the candidate’s thesis prior to (each) submission.\n3. Procedure for applying for an extension to the Thesis-pending period\nIncludes:\nplan requirements; exceptional circumstances; MRes, MSc and MA by research degrees; student fees and finance\nAll applications should be submitted with supporting evidence to Student Services or equivalent for consideration on behalf of Quality and Standards Committee (QSC). The aim will be to notify the PGR of the outcome of their application within 2 weeks.\nApplication for extension to the thesis pending period\nApplication for extension to the thesis pending period\nApplication for extension to the thesis pending period\nOther than in exceptional circumstances applications will only be considered if received by Student Services no less than 3 months in advance of the end of the thesis-pending period.\nAll applications require the support of the principal supervisor and Head of School.\nAll applications should include a plan detailing:\nWhich thesis chapters are complete\nWhat work remains to be done on incomplete chapters\nA time line for the completion of outstanding work and a date for submission of the completed thesis.\nRequests for extensions will only be considered as a result of circumstances affecting the thesis pending period, and not the period of registered study.\nStudents on MRes, MSc and MA by Research degrees are not entitled to a Thesis-pending period, but nonetheless must use this procedure if they need to apply for an extension to their submission deadline.\nIf an extension request is granted, the fee listed in the University's Fees Schedule will be payable. For more information, please consult the following:\nStudent fees and finance\n4. Procedure for applying for an extension to a resubmission or period of time allowed for minor corrections\nStudents who have already completed their examination and have further corrections or a re-submission to undertake should also use the procedure outlined in section 3 above to apply for extra time.\n5. Reasons for extensions\nIncludes:\ncircumstances that would not normally warrant an extension to Thesis-pending period\nThe following have been agreed by the University as circumstances that would normally result in an extension being granted and those which would normally not.\nExamples of circumstances which would normally lead to the approval of an extension to the Thesis-pending period:\nExceptional personal circumstances (e.g. illness, hospitalisation, accident) if having a significant impact on the writing-up process\nMaternity\nPaternity\nDeath of close relative, or illness of close relative where student is the carer\nIllness or death of partner\nProlonged jury service\nExpeditions for sport of national significance (providing the extension is acceptable to the funding body)\nRequirement for a student to undertake military service\nExamples of circumstances which would not normally warrant an extension to the Thesis-pending period:\nPaid employment during the Thesis-pending period, noting any information provided regarding the financial circumstances of the PGR.\nVoluntary service\nNote:\nThe Covid-19 exceptional regulations detail specific Covid-19 related impacts that will also be considered in cases for extensions to Thesis-pending period.\nExceptional regulations applied in response to Covid-19\nActively applied in 2019/20 and 2020/21\nCovid-19 EC Exceptional Regulations - UNUK\nCovid-19 EC Exceptional Regulations - UNNC\nCovid-19 PGR extensions to period of registered study Exceptional Regulations - UNUK\nNoted differences in 2020/21\nDuring academic year 2019/20, the University of Nottingham also introduced exceptional regulations in relation to postgraduate research extensions (including for UKRI-funded programmes, as well as the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and MPhil awards).\nOutcomes from the application of those regulations during the 2019/20 academic year, in relation to PGR extensions, will be honoured, and used in all future decision making.\nHowever, from academic year 2020/21 onwards, the Covid-19 PGR Extensions (UKRI funded) Exceptional Regulations and Covid-19 Exceptional Regulations for PGR Students will no longer be actively applied to a student's period of study.\nActively applied in 2019/20 only\nPlease be aware that the following Exceptional Regulations were developed and applied in academic year 2019/20 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

This information is primarily directed at staff across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses, but may also be of interest to students.1.0 Purpose\nThis page is to help staff who are designing new modules as well as those who are updating existing module specifications.  It provides the regulations about how to complete module specifications. Module specification content is published to both applicants and current students in the Online Curriculum catalogue.\n2.0 Key principles\nThe University has endorsed seven principles for good curriculum design. Schools are asked to review the principles in the Curriculum design document as they design programmes.\nNew Programme Design Principles\n2.1 Module details\n2.1.1 Title of module\nTitles cannot share the same name as another module. They must be short, accurately reflect the subject material contained in the syllabus, and be engaging. In cases where multiple versions of the same module exist, titles must be distinguished using brackets. For example ‘Accessing America (20 credits)’\n2.1.2 Level\nModule levels are typically aligned with the corresponding stage of a student’s degree.\nThere are five different levels of modules:\nLevel 0 – Foundation year modules have a preparatory function providing a grounding in the subject, for example, when a student lacks the relevant A-level.\nLevel 1 – Primarily for first year (Qualifying stage) students developing basic knowledge and introducing fundamental concepts and techniques. Any pre-requisites will normally be expressed in terms of relevant pre-University studies.\nLevel 2 – Primarily for second year students (Part I stage), focusing on the next phase of a student's development, possibly with pre-requisites based on Level 1 which may cover more advanced concepts and introduce different study skills.\nLevel 3 – Primarily for third year students (Part II), building on previous studies with specified pre-requisites. A wide range of study skills may be employed and developed, often with an emphasis on student-centred and student-initiated learning.\nLevel 4 – Primarily for fourth year students (Part III stage)  or those with a first degree offering extended or advanced study with pre-requisites from lower-level modules.\n2.1.3 Session\nSpecify the academic year in which the new module will first run.\n2.1.4 Summary of content\nPresent information in a concise, informative and comprehensible style, such as starting a sentence like \"This module considers...\" followed by bullet points of major topics.\n2.1.5 Content Note\nUse ‘Content note’ to highlight potentially challenging material for student awareness.\nPlease consult the following guidance for mote information about Content Notes:\nContent Notes Guidance\n2.2 Number of credits\nSpecify the number of credits.  A single credit is notionally intended to represent 10 hours of student input, whether in the form of teaching contact or private study. Credits indicate a quantity of assessed learning and are gained by satisfying the Board of Examiners.\nThe notional equivalent hours of study may not be directly applicable to University of Nottingham apprenticeship programmes where work-based learners have additional contextual opportunities to embed and test learning. Programme approval processes will ensure teaching approaches meet required outcomes for the learners on apprenticeships.\nIf, exceptionally, the assessment of a postgraduate module is not carried out by the end of the semester in which the module is offered, the credits will not in theory accrue to the student until assessment is completed in the following semester.\nAll new modules must have a credit value of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 credits. For the MRes only, larger credit sizes of 80, 100, 120, 140 or 160 are permitted.  Regulations around limits on the total number of modules of particular sizes must be applied when designing new modules.\nAny modules sizes outside of this range (including zero credit modules) or outside of the combination of modules permitted under the programme specification regulations are only permitted in exceptional circumstances (for instance where there is a PSRB requirement), and such modules require QSC approval.  Schools requiring this must submit a QSC exceptional case request via the Curriculum Approvals and Advisory Team.\n2.3 Availability to Students\n2.3.1 Availability to exchange/subsidiary/first year students\nIndicate whether the module is available to exchange students, subsidiary and first year students and state if there are any restrictions, for example only students of a particular discipline or programme.\n2.3.2 Availability to postgraduate students\nIndicate whether or not an undergraduate module can be taken by postgraduate students.\n2.4 Student numbers\nSpecify the number of students expected to enrol on the module in the following academic session.\nIf there is a cap, please indicate this and provide a rationale for the cap (see below).\n2.4.1 Rationale for Cap\nClearly explain the justification for imposing a limit on the numbers of students on the module\n2.5 Semester in which module is taught\nModules can be offered in the Autumn Semester, Spring Semester or as a \"Full Year\" (year long). A module can be offered in more than one of these periods, but one of them must be indicated as the default.\nPostgraduate (PG) modules can also be offered in the summer.\nPostgraduate dissertation/project (60 credit) modules are usually only offered as summer modules due to programme level restrictions on number of credits studied per term/semester.\nSchools with a presence in the UK and on international campuses must obtain the endorsement in good time from all relevant campuses before making any significant changes to modules (or programmes), which is particularly pertinent for 'mirror' programmes.\n2.6 Session availability\nSpecify whether the module will be taught every session or, for example, only in specific years (e.g. every other year effective from 2012).\n2.7 Requisites for the module\nRequisites should only be used where necessary to support student learning.\nPre-requisites for admission to the module (if any)\nIdentify any conditions students must meet to enrol on the module such as passing specific modules or being registered on a particular programme\nNote that only certain requisites can be programmed in Campus Solutions; requirements such as ‘must have an A Level in…’ can only be entered as text for information and will not prevent system enrolment and must be checked by the School prior to commencement of the module.\nCo-requisites for the module (if any)\nIndicate any combinations of modules that students must take together. For example ‘students must take PHYS2022 and PHYS2023’.\nAnti-requisites (if any)\nIndicate any combinations of modules that students cannot take together e.g. ‘students cannot take BUSI3010 if they have previously studied BUSI2020’.\nRemember when adding pre-, co- and anti-requisites to a module, they will apply to all students and will prevent those students who do not meet the criteria from studying the module.\n2.8 Administration details, (School(s) offering the module and percentage split)\nClearly state the School offering the module and any contributing Schools, along with the percentage split.\nEnsure that the split accurately reflects the proportion of the module taught by each School, as these figures are used to calculate student load.\n2.9 List which Schools and Faculties have been consulted (and support the proposal)\nList the Schools and Faculties consulted during the proposal, including information on their support for their proposal.\nPlease note: Submission of the module confirms that adequate consultation over resources has taken place with the library, and any other relevant resource provider (for example, DTS) and confirms that appropriate consideration of this proposal has been undertaken at School level.\n2.10 Aims\nProvide a general statement explaining the purpose of the module, its benifits for students and its role in the broader subject context. It is expected that these will vary among the different modules contributing towards the same programme. Specify the knowledge and subject-specific skills which students are expected to aquire on completion of the module – for example, the aim of a module might be to teach computer-aided design skills, which would be different from the aim of a programme which might be to teach general IT skills.\nIf the module is accredited, or will be accredited, include details about the accrediting body.\n2.11 Target students\nThis is a free text field in the module specification which musts be used to provide a clear indication to students about who can/cannot take the module and if there are any restrictions, for example:\nOnly available to Year 1 Undergraduate students on xxx degree programme. Not available to Exchange students.\nInformation in this section will not prevent a student enrolling on a module and must be checked by the school prior to commencement of the module\n2.12 Assessment period\nThe Assessment Period indicates when formal assessment of the module concludes. It will typically align with the semester, but may vary in exceptional cases – for example, an autumn module may have a formal examination in the spring and therefore an Assessment Period of \"Assessed by the end of Spring Semester.\"\nYear-long modules which have summative assessment at the end of the academic year must also include a formative or summative assessment at the end of the Autumn Semester. For avoidance of doubt, the autumn assessment does not have to be the same format at the spring assessment. For example, summative 10% in autumn with summative 90% in spring; or formative (can be different format) in autumn with summative 100% in spring; or summative 60% autumn and summative 40% spring.\n2.13 Measures to protect mobility\nWhere schools allow mobility for one semester of a year-long module, a new module for one/both semester(s) (as applicable) will need to be created to enable this.\n2.14 Other module details\nIncludes:\nmodule web links; learning outcomes; knowledge, skills and behaviours; module activities\n2.14.1 Module web links\nThis section is being removed from the form, so if it is still present when a new module is created, this section can be left blank..\n2.14.2 Learning outcomes\nIt is reasonable to have  up to six learning outcomes for a module, with some variability depending on the credit value of the module (typically with less learning outcomes for smaller credit sizes). Some cases, may warrant additional learning outcomes, for example due to Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Bodies (PSRB) requirements etc.\nModule learning outcomes may be specific to the module, the programme, or a combination of module and programme learning outcomes.\nIt is advisable to minimise the reoccurrence of the same learning outcome across multiple modules. This minimises the number of learning outcomes in each module and avoids assessing the same learning outcomes multiple times.\nLevels of assessment required to meet learning outcomes will be checked through the approval of the curriculum map.\nWhere learning outcomes for the module contribute to programme level learning outcomes these must be identified on the relevant programme’s curriculum map.\nFor further information please see the following:\nProgramme Specification information\n2.14.3 Knowledge, Skills and Behaviours (KSBs) - for Apprentice programmes only\nComplete this section for modules in an apprentice programme, consulting with the Professional and Workbased Learning team.\n2.14.4 Module activities\nProvide details about how the module will be delivered (e.g. lectures, seminars, workshops, laboratory sessions, supervision, field trips etc), including information about any teaching which is not face to face.  For example “you will be taught in a variety of ways which may include lectures and seminars”.\nPlease keep this section general and appropriate for applicants to read (more information, if needed, can be provided for current students in the module handbook).\nWhere the module in question is the dissertation, please indicate the minimum supervision arrangements. If appropriate, you would need to include a description of a range of different teaching methods..\n2.15 Module convenor\nIncludes:\nmodule contact at the international campus\nEnsure that a named member of University staff is available for all module related queries. This individual, typically a permanent member of staff, must be easily accessible to students.\nIn cases, where a module is delivered in both the UK and on an international campus, appoint a module contact at the international campus who will:\nFacilitate communication with the UK-based module convenor\nHave delegated responsibility for the modules delivery at the international campus\nBe the primary contact  for students at the international campus.\nPlease note that postgraduate students cannot be module convenors.\n2.16 Assessment details\nYou must describe each assessment element in detail, particularly the duration of examinations and the word-length of any essay, project or dissertation and if any element is non-compensable. A non-compensable module element is one which must be passed at the relevant level (40% for Honours degrees, 50% for masters' degrees, PG certificates and PG diplomas).\nExaminations, whether remote or in person, must be either 1, 2 or 3 hours in duration or, for 'take home' exams, these could also be 24 hours in duration. These durations are required (unless there is a specific reason for another duration, e.g. PSRB requirement)\nA student does have the opportunity to resit the module element for progression purposes (unless they are in their final year of study as an undergraduate), but they must achieve over the minimum level in one of their attempts to be awarded the credits associated with that module. The contribution of each assessment element to the overall module mark must be clearly specified (for example, one 1-hour examination (50%); one 1,500 word essay (50%)).\nIn addition:\nAssessment practices are expected to be informed by reflection, consideration of professional practice, as well as subject-specific and educational scholarship.\nThe volume, timing and nature of assessment enable students to demonstrate the extent to which they have achieved the intended learning outcomes.\nWhere a 20-credit module is created from two 10-credit modules, the volume of assessment of the new module must be significantly less than the aggregate assessment of the two former modules.\nThe assessment for a module must only be the minimum necessary to test its learning outcomes, whilst still complying with the aforementioned exam duration limitations where the assessments are exams.\nWhere it is felt necessary to have more than one component of assessment to cover all the learning outcomes, assessing any given learning outcome more than once is expected to be avoided.\nThere must not be more than one timetabled examination for a module, except where it is necessary to have both a written and a practical examination.\nPlease note that either/or assessment options are not permitted where the assessment type and/or element weightings are different.\nIt is an established principle of the University, that when registered for a University of Nottingham qualification all teaching and assessment must be in English. The only exception is where the subject of study is a language or literature other than English.\nWhere a student must repeat their enrolment in order to be reassessed in a specific module this must be stated in the module specification.\nThe form of reassessment of the module will be the same as the original assessment, unless stated to the contrary in this section. If the reassessment is different, it must consist of either a single examination or a single coursework assessment that replaces all the failed assessment components of the module for reassessment purposes. Where the different reassessment is an examination, then as above it must be either 1, 2 or 3 hours in duration or, for 'take home' exams, these could also be 24 hours in duration. These durations are required (unless there is a specific reason for another duration, e.g. PSRB requirement)\n2.17 Flexible and inclusive assessment\nThere are many ways of making assessments more inclusive to recognise individual students’ challenges and situations. One approach is to introduce an element of flexibility. If there is more than one way of meeting the learning outcomes, students can be given a degree of choice over how they do this, noting bullet 7 in section 2.16 above (i.e. that either/or assessment options are not permitted where the assessment type and/ or element weightings are different). The choice can be constrained appropriately by the options offered and managed by schools locally.\nThe details of any flexibility available must be clearly stated in the guidance given to all students about the assessment. It is also recommended that a record of the student’s choice regarding the version of an assessment that a student selected is kept at least until 2 months after the relevant exam board. If the student’s choice is obvious by the format or nature of the submission via Moodle, then simply retaining the submission box on Moodle would satisfy this recommendation.\nFor more information about setting inclusive or flexible assessment please\nsee these examples\n2.18 Higher Education Classification of Subjects (HeCOS) Codes\nThe University's Planning, Performance and Strategic Change Division (PPSC) compiles an annual student data return for the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). As part of this process, HeCOS, or 'subject' data codes for all modules taken by our students must be provided. This data is used to:\nidentify 'strategically important and vulnerable subjects' which may lead to additional funding for certain subjects\ndefine the particularly sensitive subjects that international students and researchers must apply for an Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate\ndecide on the subject grouping it is published in within performance metrics, such as the OfS student outcomes dashboard as well as publications such as league tables.\nA HECoS code that is too vague or not reflective of a course content and relation to a broader subject group has the potential to have a profound impact.  Please consult the following for more information about HECoS codes:\nHigher Education Classification of Subjects (HECoS) codes\n3.0 Related Regulations, Policies and Procedures\nFor more information about the University of Nottingham Qualification Framework, please see:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualification Framework\nFor Programme specifcation guidance, please see the following:\nProgramme specification guidance\nFor more information about intercampus programme types, please see:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualification Framework\nFor information about Degree apprenticeships, please consult the following SharePoint\nDegree apprenticeships\nFor queries about the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) return,  please contact PPSC:\nPlanning, performance and strategic change\nFor more information about setting inclusive or flexible assessment, please see these examples:\nInclusive or flexible assessment examples\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please email:\nss-curriculumadvice@nottingham.ac.uk\n4.0 Version control table\nVersion control table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nClarifications made as part of a review of this section of the Quality Manual.  Also reformatted to align with new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework\nQSC\nAugust 2024\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please email:\nss-curriculumadvice@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n20 September 2024||"

Its content is primarily directed at UK-based staff and students but may also be of interest to those at the international campuses.Please be aware that during academic year 2020/21, the University introduced additional guidance in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. This page was previously affected by these arrangements and has been documented accordingly.\nFurther details can be found in the \"Additional guidance in 2020/21 due to Covid-19\" section below.\n1. Policy\nIncludes:\nnumbers required\nEvery School shall have at least one full-time member of academic staff designated to act as an independent School Postgraduate Student Adviser (SPSA) to advise research students and to deal confidentially with any concern raised by research students about their research studies and supervision.\n2.  Appointment procedure\nIncludes:\nresponsibilities\nHeads of School shall nominate a School Postgraduate Student Advisor (SPSA) and shall inform the University of the name of the SPSA, which should also be included in the School Handbook.\n3.  Role of the School Postgraduate Student Advisor\nIncludes:\nconfidentiality; when also a student supervisor; additional services and support\nThe SPSA shall have responsibility for providing support, as noted in section 1 above, to all Research Postgraduate students registered with their home school. Responsibility for PGRs does not extend to the corresponding school on an international campus, although cross campus cooperation between SPSAs is encouraged on common areas.\nThe School Postgraduate Student Advisor (SPSA) is available to offer independent and strictly confidential advice and support to research students who, for example, have a query about University, Faculty and School regulations and procedures relating to research study; are concerned about the progress of their research work and the facilities or resources available to them; are having difficulties with the supervisory relationship (including a complete breakdown of that relationship); or who have any other query relating to their research studies at Nottingham.\nIf the SPSA is the student's supervisor, the student should seek guidance from any other member of School academic staff.\nThe SPSA should advise the student as is required and, if they cannot answer the student's query, should indicate to the student what sources of expert advice and support exist within the University (eg. Counselling Service, or Researcher Academy). For more information about these services, please consult the following:\nResearcher Academy\nThe University Counselling Services\n4. Record of consultations\nIncludes:\nexpectations; confidentiality; reporting options\nWhen a research student requests a meeting with the School Postgraduate Student Advisor (SPSA) on a serious matter concerning their research studies and/or supervision, the SPSA should make a careful record of the problem and the discussions (the record should be agreed with the student), including the outcome and any proposed course of action.\nWhere appropriate, the SPSA may offer to mediate between the student and other staff and students in the School, including the supervisor. Subject to the degree of confidentiality agreed with the student, the SPSA should report the problem to the Head of School and, if appropriate, Registry and Academic Affairs.\nAdditional guidance in 2020/21 due to Covid-19\nPlease be aware that the following guidance was developed and applied during academic year 2020/21 in response to the coronavirus pandemic. These additional responsibilities were specific to Heads of School, Supervisors and Directors of PGR Programmes and should be read in conjunction with all other content on this page:\nResponsibilities of the Head of School, Supervisor and Director of PGR Programme - Additional guidance for the 2020-21 academic year in response to Covid-19\nThis guidance appeared alongside the University's Exceptional Regulations that were developed and applied in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\nFor more information about the Exceptional Regulations as a whole, please consult the following:\nExceptional Regulations: Covid-19 - 2019/20 - 2020/21\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nGraduate School - PGR\nGS-PGR@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n25 April 2024||"

Its content applies to staff at the China campus only.Evaluation of teaching processes are currently under review. Whilst work is ongoing to develop an alternative approach, Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET) surveys no longer take place for staff on the UK or UNM campuses. There is no requirement to include historic SET data in promotion cases; revised guidance can be found on the HR promotions website.\n1. Frequency of collection of Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET) surveys\nIncludes:\nEVALUATE; exceptions; failure to meet targets; justification\n1.1\nStudent Evaluation of Teaching (SET) data must be collected using EVALUATE. The normal expectation is that staff included in the policy (see Section 2. Identification of staff and modules for SET) should conduct at least one SET survey during an academic year.\n1.2\nA School may decide in certain circumstances that some individuals are to be evaluated by SET more frequently over an agreed period of time. The following is a selection of such circumstances:\n1.2.1\nThe individual is new to teaching and SET results will be useful to support the development of teaching skills.\n1.2.2\nThe individual intends to apply for promotion and needs to collect SET over a period of time to fulfil the promotions criteria.\n1.2.3\nThe individual has been identified through their Appraisal and Development Conversation (ADC) as needing to improve their teaching and frequent SET results are needed to track progress of this.\n1.3\nIf any cases arise where a member of teaching academic staff has not conducted at least one SET survey in an academic year this should be brought to the attention of the Faculty Associate Dean for Education and Student Experience (UNNC), and justified.\n2. Identification of staff and modules for SET\nIncludes:\nscope; Head of School responsibilities; relationship with previous SET; additional surveys\nAll Research and Teaching and Teaching-focused staff who are teaching on Campus Solutions registered modules must be evaluated by SET. This applies regardless of the contracted hours with the University. Associates of the University can be evaluated by SET, including guest speakers and postgraduate research students who teach.\n2.1\nIn rare cases a member of staff may only teach 4 hours or less in a teaching year. If this situation arises then the Head of School (or delegate) may decide that the individual should be exempt from SET, but they must have their teaching peer-observed.\n2.2\nThe Head of School (or delegate) is responsible for identifying one module per year for which a member of staff should undertake SET.\n2.3\nThat module should not normally be the same module that received SET the year before, and should where possible be a module for which the staff member is teaching a significant number of students (20 or more).\n2.4\nAny individual member of staff should be able to request additional SET surveys for any contribution they make to teaching for which they would like feedback (e.g. for professional development or module enhancement, or to support a promotion application or Lord Dearing Award application, etc.). Requests to set up additional SET surveys should be made directly to the Academic Services Office (UNNC). Modules which are not in Campus Solutions can be evaluated by using a non-standard survey.\n3. Staff responsibilities\nIncludes:\nopening and closing dates; provision of information; time; Blue Castle; EVALUATE; discussion of reports.\nStaff who are being evaluated by SET have certain responsibilities that they must fulfil with support from their School. These are:\n3.1\nEnsure that an appropriate date and time for opening and closing the EVALUATE survey is agreed with the relevant Faculty office so as to maximise student participation.\n3.2\nInform students at the appropriate time of the purpose of the survey and the period during which it will be live.\n3.3\nEnsure that students have time to complete the survey.\n3.4\nDisplay the information necessary to students to enable them to complete the survey. This is the Blue Castle address and the PIN if a non-standard survey is being used.\n3.5\nConsider using the Survey Monitor (in Blue Castle) to encourage participation.\n3.6\nInform the relevent Faculty office if a survey fails to run for any reason so that the survey can be re-opened.\n3.7\nBe prepared to discuss SET reports as part of the Appraisal and Development Conversation (ADC).\n3.8\nUnderstand that there are no circumstances in which a student’s responses can be changed. The student can request that their responses are deleted by emailing the EVALUATE team, but will not be able to complete that particular survey again.\nIf you wish to request the deletion of your responses, please email:\nEvaluate@nottingham.ac.uk\n4. Access to SET results\nIncludes:\nconfidentiality; permission to publish scores; promotions committee\n4.1\nSET results are regarded as confidential to the individual and a range of School, Faculty and University staff who have specified organisational roles to fulfil which require access to individual scores.\n4.2\nStaff should be permitted (but not required) to publish their SET scores.\n4.3\nMembers of the Management Board and Faculty Associate Dean for Educations and Student Experience (UNNC) will have access to all Faculty and all School SET reports both for the current year and for all previous years. This will include the ability to view individual SET reports (both scores and comments).\n4.4\nMembers of Promotions Committee will have access to the SET scores of individuals submitting promotion cases.\n4.5\nThe Head of School has access to all individual SET reports within the School including scores and comments in the current year and in all previous years. The Head of School will also have access to the overall School SET report.\n4.6\nOther relevant Faculty and School based staff who might have good reason to be given access to individual reports can be identified by the Faculty Associate Dean for Educations and Student Experience (UNNC). Levels of access may vary between Schools and Faculties but the following staff should be considered for access:\nSchool Directors of Teaching and Learning (or equivalent);\nFaculty Heads of Education and Student Experience (or equivalent);\nOperations Managers;\nAppraisal and Development Conversation (ADC) reviewers;\n4.7\nOther University departments and individuals will from time to time require access to individual SET reports to fulfil their role or carry out a specific function. Examples include Human Resources for a range of actions including disciplinary, grievance and performance processes and the Lord Dearing Award judging panel.\n5. Dealing with abusive comments\nIncludes:\nreporting abuse; University code of discipline; Student User Guide; disciplinary action\n5.1\nAbusive and personal comments are unacceptable and need to be removed from the EVALUATE system as quickly as possible.\n5.2\nAny individual receiving a comment that they identify as being abusive should report the abuse to a person agreed by the school, e.g. Head of School or Director of Learning and Teaching.  The abusive comment should be reported by the agreed person to the EVALUATE team who will remove the student’s ratings and abusive comments.\nIf you wish to report an abusive comment, please email:\nEvaluate@nottingham.ac.uk\n5.3\nIn deciding whether a comment is abusive the agreed person should use common sense principles and if necessary refer to the University Code of Discipline and the Code of Practice for users of the University computing facilities.\nMore information can be found here:\nUniversity code of discipline\nCode of Practice for users of the University computing facilities\n5.4\nStudents are informed of the seriousness of submitting abusive comments in the Student User Guide and it is recommended that Schools remind students of their responsibilities and indicate the seriousness of breaking the Discipline and Computing Facilities Codes.\nStudent User Guide\n5.5\nIn principle authors of offensive comments can be identified and disciplinary action could be taken if deemed necessary.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n24 June 2024||"

Collection of Student Evaluation of Module (SEM) surveys\nIncludes:\nEVALUATE; modules taught by more than one teacher\n1.1\nStudent Evaluation of Module (SEM) data must be collected using EVALUATE. The normal expectation will be that every module should be subject to SEM every academic year, but modules can be surveyed more than once when appropriate\n1.2\nWhere a module is taught by more than one teacher the School should appoint one of the teaching team to collect the SEM evaluation.

Levels of access may vary between Schools and Faculties but the following staff should be considered for access:\nSchool Directors of Education and Student Experience (or equivalent)\nHeads of Education and Student Experience (or equivalent)\n4. Publication of SEM results\nIncludes:\nscores, comments and responses; availability; feedback or module review template; location\n4.1\nA summary response to the most recent student feedback available, such as SEM surveys must be published by the School within a reasonable time frame.\n4.2\nPublished scores must be available to students who have completed the module and to students who might be undertaking the module in the future.\n4.3\nSEM scores should be published within a feedback or module review template (one is available in Blue Castle) and the teacher/module convenor must provide a commentary in response to the scores and comments.

The impact of an extension to enrolment can be to give a Learner another assessment submission at a later date.\nA Learner may request an enrolment extension through the Extenuating Circumstances Regulation at any point up to the last working day before the final submission point of your Microcredential. Requests made on or after the final assessment submission deadline will not normally be considered.\nIf unable to submit an assessment on time and/or unable to continue with their Microcredential, a Learner must submit an extenuating circumstances claim if they wish UoNO to consider their situation.\nA Learner can only be granted one extenuating circumstances claim on each Microcredential and to a duration no longer than that required to allow them access to one further submission point.\nIf a Learner has enrolled onto a Microcredential through sponsorship, their extenuating circumstances request may be subject to approval from their respective funding scheme or employer.\nA Learner will not be asked to provide evidence to support their extenuating circumstances claim. We will ask Learners to outline the circumstances impacting their ability to complete the Microcredential.Extenuating circumstances are situations or events that meet all of the following criteria:\nExceptional - different to what a student has to deal with in their usual day-to-day life.\nOutside of a student’s control – there was nothing that the student could do to stop it happening.\nNegative impact – it must have had a demonstrably significant, negative impact on the student’s ability to study or to undertake an assessment.\nThe timing of the circumstances must be relevant to the claimed impact; these are usually short-term in nature.\nThe impacted period of learning can be any period that has occurred during the Learner’s enrolment on the microcredential.As long as the Learner’s circumstances satisfy these conditions, and it is the Learner’s first request, the request will be granted.Following an extension, it is the Learner’s responsibility to ensure that they have read and understood the current assessment criteria of the Microcredential as these may change during the extended period of enrolment.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n14 March 2024||"

Such cases must be submitted for consideration by QSC by an appropriate person with delegated authority on behalf of the relevant school or professional service\nmonitoring Schools' decisions on extenuating circumstances claims\nbeing prepared to act as members of working groups, or periodic review panels established by the University’s Education and Student Experience Committee and to assist the University’s Assistant Pro-Vice-Chancellor (APVC) for Teaching and Curriculum Leadership in communicating with Schools on teaching and learning developments\nAll Schools are expected to recognise their member of QSC's contribution to the University in their assignment of staff workloads.\n4.3.2 Conflict of duties\nMembers of QSC may not be able to take on posts at school or faculty level which may sometimes be in conflict with the duties of the role as outlined above.\nMembers of QSC will not be given items for consideration which have been put forward for approval by their own School.\n4.3.3 Support for Committee members\nIn all of the above activities, members can expect to receive full support and guidance from appropriate members of Registry and the Admissions team. This will include providing information on precedents in handling appeals cases and on arranging discussion of issues arising from the approval of programme specifications.\nIn some cases, the Committee may need to take actions notwithstanding regulations. Guidance, in the event of such situations, can be found in the following:\nQSC guidance on decisions notwithstanding regulations\n5.0 Related Policies\nFrom July 2020, all Policies included within the Quality Manual will also been listed within a dedicated Policies section, which will functions as a directory.

Overview\nThe University of Nottingham may sometimes verify the claims made by Continuing professional development (CPD) providers for their learning products. In so-doing, UoN does not thereby endorse or recommend the learning product. Rather, through verification, UoN confirms that the learning product does what is claimed for it, by the CPD provider.\nIn particular, through verification UoN confirms that learners successfully completing the learning product will have met the learning outcomes claimed for the learning product by the CPD provider.\n2. UoNO Regulation on Verification\n2.1\nVerification may only be offered for learning products that are below degree level (i.e. at level 5 or below). These products may\nnot\nbe used for Recognition of Other Learning for degree credits.\n2.2\nWhere verification is offered, learners successfully completing the learning product will receive a digital badge from UoN that confirms their successful completion of the learning product. This badging is not recognised by UoN as contributing to the completion of any degree qualification.\n2.3\nBefore verification can begin, UoNO must satisfy itself that the prospective client is of suitable standing by undertaking due diligence and forwarding a business case to the Planning and Resource Committee (PRC) UoNO sub-committee for consideration and decision.\n2.4\nThe verification process has three phases, each requiring some review. Prior to commencing those phases, Academic Experts and External Reviewers must be pre-approved by QSC.\n2.5   Phase 1 - Review of the CPD provider’s platform and materials:\nProviders delivery platform and materials  are reviewed to confirm that learners successfully completing the learning product should meet the learning outcomes claimed for the learning product by the CPD provider and should be able to do so with the support proposed by the provider.\n2.6   Phases 2 and 3 post completion of the learning product reviews:\nFollowing successful completion of phase 1, UoN will evaluate each learner cohort in order to determine whether a digital badge will be issued to that cohort.\n2.7   Phase 2  A Post delivery review:\nCPD provider’s platform and materials are re-reviewed for a specific learning product after learners have completed that product to confirm that the CPD provider used the platform and materials first reviewed in phase 1 (and/or any deviations were non-material).\n2.8   Phase 3 Monitoring of standards:\nEvaluation of a sample of the learners’ completed work and feedback, alongside evaluation of any marking rubrics used to confirm that the work completed is of a standard that demonstrates that learners successfully completing the learning product have met the learning outcomes claimed for the learning product by the CPD provider.\nOn successful completion of all three phases by the University, learners in the relevant cohort will be issued with a digital badge.\nThe phases must be completed in order.  If any phase is not successfully completed, a digital badge will not be issued to the cohort in question.\n2.9   Annual review\nAn Annual Review of the verification products and processes undertaken by an External Reviewer will be undertaken for all verifications.\nThe annual review is the means by which the university ensures that  UoN policy and processes were followed effectively and  to  ensure that the learning products being verified are of a  suitable standard, and that the student performances are judged appropriately.  The aim of this process is\nnot\nto scrutinise learners’ work or individual programmes/teaching materials that have been verified.\n3. Process for Verification\n3.1\nThis process outlines the steps that must be gone through for UoNO to verify the online provision of a provider external to UoN and to award a UoN digital badge to learners.\n3.2\nVerification may only be offered in cases where the online provision is not credit bearing and UoNO verified online provision may not be used for the award of credit at the University of Nottingham.\n3.3\nA digital badge acts as digital confirmation that the learner has achieved the learning outcomes of the learning product. For the award of a digital badge to learners, all three phases of the verification process must be completed with approval.\n3.4\nThe process may be halted at any stage and by either the client or UoN.\n3.5   Phase 0:\nPrior to the initiation of Phase 1, UoNO must satisfy itself that the prospective client is of suitable standing by undertaking due diligence, including steps a - e.\n(a)\nWhen a client approaches UoNO to request verification, the Academic Director of UoNO determines whether or not the scope and scale of the project are appropriate for verification, and whether or not the UoNO wishes to partner with the client (including liaising with UoNO CEO regarding the potential new client). Approval at this stage does not commit UoNO to verification. This step of the process is purely to confirm initial interest in the project on the part of UoNO.\n(b)\nThe client is asked to confirm that they wish to engage in the verification process, with all aspects explained to them, including: timelines, pricing and process.\n(c)\nThe Business Case for partnering with the client should be prepared and submitted to the Planning and Resource Committee (PRC) UoNO  sub-committee for consideration.   The Business   Case should include information on the proposed verification, the due diligence undertaken and the pricing model, and any other information requested by the committee.\n(d)\nIf the PRC UoNO sub-committee recommends to PRC that the proposed verification project can be approved, and this is agreed, confirmation will be provided to the CEO/Academic Director in writing.\n(e)\nOnce approval has been given, the project can move to Phase 1. UoNO and the prospective client may start work for Phase 1, at risk, prior to formal approval being given.\n3.6   Phase 1 - Review of the CPD provider’s platform and materials:\nA review of the CPD provider’s platform and materials for each specific learning product. The goal of Phase 1 is to confirm that learners successfully completing the learning product should meet the learning outcomes claimed for the learning product by the CPD provider and should do so with the support claimed by the provider.\n(a)\nWorking with HR and Schools, UoNO must recruit Academic Experts from the wider UoN to engage in any/each of the phases verification process and outcomes review. Academic Experts external to the UoN are not permitted for the Phase 1, 2 or 3 reviews.  The Academic Expert(s) need to be a subject area expert with suitable qualifications (eg. AFHEA)  and should also have experience in the development, implementation and/or design of teaching programmes. They would usually have external examiner experience. If required, this could be more than one person. Please see the ‘guidance for Appointment of Academic Experts’ (Appendix 1 of the Academic Expert Nomination form) for more information.\n(b)\nIf such Academic Experts cannot be found to do the reviewing, verification cannot proceed.\n(c)\nThese Academic Experts require QSC approval prior to undertaking any review work (see template Academic Expert nomination form).\n(d)\nThe recruitment process will be managed by UoNO, in collaboration with HR as necessary.\n(e)\nThe Academic Expert(s) must complete the Phase 1 Verification Template (see template Phase 1 verification template ) and send to the UoNO Academic Director. In completing the Phase 1 Verification Template, the Academic Expert(s) should consult the Guidance on Standards for Verification.\n(i)\nIf no concerns are raised, the Academic Director should confirm that verification will be granted and the Academic Director must send the completed Phase 1 Verification Template to QSC for report (ss-qsc-cases@exmail.nottingham.ac.uk). The Academic Director may also ask QSC for guidance or advice if they wish to do so.\n(ii)\nIf concerns are raised, or more information is requested by the Academic Expert(s), the Academic Director may either ask the client for more information, or else they should decline to grant verification. There is no upper limit on the number of times that additional information may be sought.\n(iii)\nIf granted, Phase 1 verification of the learning product will last for 12 months. The only exception to this is if UoNO has concerns raised through Phase 3 that the learning product is not enabling learners to meet learning outcomes.\n(iv)\nIn advance of the 12 month period coming to a close, the Academic Director of UoNO should commence the Phase 1 verification process once again. If not renewed by the 12 month deadline, then Phase 1 verification will automatically lapse at the 12 month mark.\n(v)\nIf verification lapses, the UoNO Academic Director must inform QSC  that Phase 1 verification has lapsed.\n(vi)\nOnce verification is granted, the client may not make alterations to the provision without approval. If they wish to do make changes, they must contact the Academic Director who will determine whether the changes are minor and do not affect Phase 1 verification, whether to re-instigate the Phase 1 verification process described above, or whether to remove verification. Anything other than minor changes should be reported to QSC (minor changes would be picked up in a Phase 2 review).\n(vii)\nPhase 1 may be completed without completing Phases 2 and 3.\nUoN guidance on standards for verification\nAcademic expert nomination form\nExternal Reviewer nomination form\n3.7   Phase 2 - Post delivery review:\nPhase 2 consists of a re-review of the CPD provider’s platform and materials for a specific learning product after the learners have completed the learning product, to confirm that the CPD provider used of the platform and materials first reviewed in Phase 1 (and/or any deviations were non-material).  This review is required prior to a Phase 3 review (for learners’ digital badges).\nFor avoidance of doubt, Phase 1 must precede Phase 2.  The Academic Expert(s) do not have to be the same person/people as the Phase 1 review, but may be.\nThe Academic Expert(s) must complete the Phase 2 Verification Template  and send to the UoNO Academic Director. In completing the Phase 2 Verification Template, the Academic Expert(s) should consult the Guidance on Standards for Verification . Any deviations from the Phase 1 approval should be highlighted and discussed by the Academic Expert and Academic Director to determine if those change invalidate Phase 1.\n(a)\nIf no concerns are raised, the Academic Director should confirm that Phase 2 re-verification will be granted and the Academic Director must send the Phase 2 Verification Template  to QSC for report (ss-qsc-cases@exmail.nottingham.ac.uk). The Academic Director may also ask QSC for guidance or advice if they wish to do so.\n(b)\nIf concerns are raised, or more information is requested by Academic Expert(s), the Academic Director may either ask the client for more information, or else they should decline to grant verification. There is no upper limit on the number of times that additional information may be sought.\n3.8   Phase 3 - Monitoring of standards:\n3.8.1\nPhase 3 consists in an evaluation of a sample of the learners’ completed work and feedback, alongside any marking rubrics used to confirm that the work completed is of a standard that demonstrates that learners successfully completing the learning product have met the learning outcomes claimed for the learning product by the CPD provider.\n3.8.2\nFor avoidance of doubt, Phases 1 and 2 must precede Phase 3.  The Academic Expert(s) would normally be the same person/people as Phase 2, but may be different.\n(a)\nThe Academic Expert must review learner outcomes within each cohort in order for the UoN digital badge to be awarded to learners within that cohort.\n(b)\nIt is necessary for the Academic Expert to be able to select which learners work is reviewed.  Work should be reviewed from a minimum of 25% of the cohort up to a maximum of the work of 40 learners, depending on cohort size. This sample should be selected randomly but should include at least one submission from each mark range (where they exist): e.g. 0-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-100. Additionally, all fails should be reviewed.\n(c)\nThe Academic Expert(s) must complete a review of learner work and feedback as well as the marking rubrics, and complete the Phase 3 Verification Template  and send to the Academic Director. In completing the Phase 3 Verification Template, the Academic Expert(s) should consult the Guidance on Standards for Verification.\n(i)\nIf no concerns are raised, the Academic Director can confirm to the client that the Phase 3 review has been satisfied, and UoN digital badges may be issued to the learners within that cohort who have satisfied the learning outcomes specified. The Academic Director must send the completed Phase 3 Verification template to QSC (ss-qsc-cases@exmail.nottingham.ac.uk) for report.\n(ii)\nIf concerns are raised, or the Academic Expert asks for additional information, the Academic Director may either ask the client for more information, or else they should inform the client that UoN Digital Badges may not be issued to this cohort. .  If the Academic Director reaches the decision that UoN Digital Badges may not be issued to this cohort, this decision should be reported to QSC (ss-qsc-cases@exmail.nottingham.ac.uk) and the learning product should be re-reviewed using the verification process described above.\n3.8.3\nUoNO must maintain a complete and up to date record of all verified courses and Phase 3 outcomes reviews and award (or not) of digital badges, with accompanying documentation.\n3.9   Annual Review:\n3.9.1\nThe verification of external learning products will be reviewed annually by an External Reviewer who will be asked to review materials produced by UoN Academic Expert(s), including verification reports and reviews of outcomes. For avoidance of doubt, the External Review does not review the underlying materials provided by the external CPD provider.\n3.9.2\nThe purpose of the external annual review is to establish whether the regulations and processes around verification are being correctly implemented, and to give external advice as to how the regulations and processes might be improved. It will enable the University to ensure that the learning products being verified are of a suitable standard, and that the student performances are judged appropriately.\n3.9.3\nUoNO are to recruit this External Reviewer using the approach described in the External Examiner for taught courses process . External Reviewers are appointed on an annual basis up to a normal maximum of four years' service.  UoNO will need to ensure that they nominate suitable candidates for the roles of External Reviewer, ensuring the External Reviewer Nomination forms for appointment of External   Reviewer are sent to the Quality and Student Management Systems team for approval by QSC.\n3.9.4\nThe External Reviewers are asked to complete the External Review template form . Once this is complete, it should be sent to the Quality and Student Management Systems team for QSC consideration as part of the PG annual review cycle.\n4.

Its content is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Policy\nThis guidance should be read in conjunction with the Progression Review of Research Students section of the Quality Manual and all other policies on Research Degrees, especially all other Research Degree regulations and the University policy on personal relationships at work.\nFor doctoral students undergoing Progression Review in Stage 1 and 2, an in-person meeting between PGR and an Internal Assessor is required.\nFor more information about Progression Review, please consult the following:\nPGR Progression Review - Process Map\nRegulations for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and Master of Philosophy (MPhil)\nAn Internal Assessor is strongly recommended in Stage 3 Progression Review for independent scrutiny, consistency and quality assurance.\n1. Eligibility to act as Internal Assessor\nThe Internal Assessor(s) should:\nhave (co)supervised at least one PGR student to completion OR\nhave examined at least one UK PhD OR\nhave completed at least one previous UK progression review for a research degree.\nundertake continuing professional development in relevant postgraduate educational areas\npossess sufficient knowledge of the subject area relating to the PGR’s degree programme to be able to effectively assess progress.\nnormally be a University of Nottingham employee or have a contractual arrangement with UoN (e.g. a Memorandum of Understanding).\nIt is appropriate in some cases to identify individuals from other schools/departments or alternative suitable environments provided that those individuals have appropriate and relevant knowledge of the PGR's field/discipline and hold professional status equivalent to a University of Nottingham academic position (i.e. R&T or R Assistant/Associate/full Professor).\nbe independent from the student and all members of the supervisory team including any external supervisors.\nnot have any personal relationship with the PGR or the supervisory team throughout the candidate’s journey.\nIf the only suitable Internal Assessor does not have necessary experience of PGR co-supervision then a mentor can be appointed to support the development of the Internal Assessor and ensure assessment process is followed in the first year.\nIf a relationship develops between the Assessor and PGR, the Assessor should step down and inform the Head of School.\nThe Head of School may delegate some or all of the responsibilities in this Policy to a suitable deputy, for example the School/ PGR Director. For the purposes of this Policy, the use of ‘School’ also includes Research Groups in the Faculty of Engineering, and, only when appropriate and Progression Review is managed through Doctoral Training Programmes/Centres for Doctoral Training, DTP /CDT Directors.\n2. Appointment of the Internal Assessor\nThe appointment of the Internal Assessor should be initiated, and the PGR made aware of this, within 3 months of the PGR’s first registration.\nThe Head of School should approve the appointment of the Internal Assessor with input from the supervisory team and PGR.\nIf an Internal Assessor is unable to continue in post throughout the PGR’s period of registered study, or either the student and /or supervisors request a change, a new Internal Assessor will be appointed as soon as possible.\nSchools may appoint more than one Internal Assessor for a PGR, with consideration of workload and expertise, and for a justifiable reason, for example if the research is inter- or transdisciplinary. All Internal Assessors must be actively engaged in and contribute to the formal Progression Review of the PGR, including attending the required meeting.\nSchools should consider whether the appointment of a particular Internal Assessor would risk the introduction of the perception of bias or conflict of interest into the process. Where such a risk is identified, the Head of School should always take the option of appointing a different Assessor.\n3. The role of the Internal Assessor\nThe Internal Assessor is appointed to:\nensure that the formal Progression Review is independent, robust, fair and unbiased;\nidentify whether the PGR is making sufficient progress against the published criteria , or not, and if not be part of a process to remedy the situation;\nFor more information about assessment criteria for Progression Reviews, please consult the following:\nAssessment criteria for Progression Reviews\nmaintain and enhance the University’s reputation for academic excellence;\nprovide valuable feedback to PGRs to help them develop academically;\nensure that PGRs are receiving appropriate support that allows them to be successful in their research;\nprovide an independent recommendation on PGR progression through engagement with the review process.\nThe Internal Assessor can, under appropriate circumstances, also act as the Internal Examiner for the PGR, but is not required to do so. In order to act in this capacity, they must fulfil all the requirements for an External Examiner, particularly those relating to appropriate expertise in the field/discipline. If an Internal Assessor, supervisors or School feels that the monitoring of the PGR’s progression results in any conflict of interest, or lack of impartiality that would interfere with an impartial examination of the thesis, the Internal Assessor should not act as the Internal Examiner.\n4.\nResponsibilities of the Internal Assessor\nThe Internal Assessor should:\ninitiate the arrangements for each Progression Review (at all stages) and agree a date, time and place for a meeting with the PGR, preferably 3 months prior to the date to ensure adequate preparation time;\nThe Office of the Independent Adjudicator requires that the PGR not be responsible for the organisation of their own assessment.\nprovide an agenda for the meeting to the PGR at least 1 week before the meeting, and explain how the meeting will be conducted at the start, to ensure the PGR knows what to expect;\nensure that the Progression Review (at all stages) is conducted in a timely fashion, including both the scrutiny of the presented report and other evidence and the progression meeting. This is to allow the evidence to be evaluated, and the recommendation for progression to be made in a timeframe that allows for reassessment, should this be required, by the anniversary of the PGRs original date of registration;\nbe made aware of any extenuating circumstances that need to be taken into consideration with respect to the formal Progression Review, and plan the timing accordingly;\nread, take account of and evaluate the PGR’s progress using the information in the review documentation (including supervisory meeting notes, training records, the written report, research plan and accommodations), and assess progress against the published stage-specific criteria;\nFor more information about assessment criteria for Progression Reviews, please consult the following:\nAssessment criteria for Progression Reviews\nmeet with the PGR and discuss the information in the report and other information, and assess progress against the published stage-specific criteria;\nprovide supportive and constructive feedback in the meeting, and in the report form, based on the assessment criteria;\nprovide feedback to relevant individuals if any concerns arise in connection with safety or well-being as a result of the discussions;\nprovide a fair and constructive independent report on PGR progression to the Head of School in a timely manner;\nagree a joint recommendation with the supervisors as to whether the PGR should progress or not to the next stage of study;\nand, if the joint recommendation requires re-assessment of PGR progression,\nengage with the re-assessment of the PGR’s progression, contributing to the information provided to the PGR on the expectations and requirements for improvement and a re-assessment meeting;\nprovide, with the supervisors, the timeframe in which the PGR will need to show improvement, the objectives and milestones to demonstrate the required improvement, and the criteria against which this will be assessed;\nagree the date of reassessment with the supervisors and PGR as soon as possible after the recommendation for re-assessment is made.\nFeedback on the Progression Review provided to the PGR should be based on the criteria as applicable to the stage and field/discipline, and should include comment on the performance in the written report, the meeting, and any other information provided to the Internal Assessor, including the supervision record, related to the following:\nthe key achievements to date in the PGR's research progress, training and development, and required qualities and skills;\nthe degree of existing knowledge and understanding in the field or area of study, including understanding of relevant techniques and methodologies;\nthe degree to which the PGR’s plan has/will enable them to demonstrate the generation of new / original knowledge in their project;\nwhether the PGR can communicate effectively to different and appropriate audiences through different means;\nwhether the PGR can show effective and responsive planning for the focus and direction of their planned work and how they have honed this through pilot work, or if they have encountered problems.

Its content is primarily directed at staff across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Please be aware that during academic year 2020/21, the University introduced additional guidance in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. This page was previously affected by these arrangements and has been documented accordingly.\nFurther details can be found in the \"Additional guidance in 2020/21 due to Covid-19\" section below.\n1. Policy\nEvery research thesis will be evaluated by Examiners who have appropriate academic qualifications, relevant expertise in the area of research being examined, and a suitable level of experience in examining research degree submissions.\nEvery member of academic staff of this University or another institution who is appointed to act as an Internal or External Examiner will receive information on the role of the Examiners.\n2. Notification of intent to submit\nIncludes:\nSubmission information pack for postgraduate research students document\nThe submission by the student of a Notification of submission of thesis for examination of a research degree form which has been signed by the supervisor will trigger the procedure for nomination of Examiners.\nNotification of submission of thesis for examination of a research degree\nNotification of submission of thesis for examination of a research degree\nThe Notification form should be submitted at least three months in advance of the proposed submission of the thesis so that there is sufficient time to organise the appointment of Examiners before the thesis is submitted.\nOn receipt of the Notification form, the Head of School will nominate individuals whom they wish to act as Internal and External Examiners for the research submission. The Head of School may involve the supervisor(s) and candidate in discussions on suitable examiners, but will be responsible for making the final decision on the nomination.\nOnce discussions are completed, the nomination should be sent by the Head of School on the standard form to Registry and Academic Affairs, the Postgraduate Research Team or equivalent for approval by the University. There should be no contact between candidates and Examiners from the appointment of the Examiners up to the date of the viva voce examination, other than to make arrangements for the viva to take place.\n3. Internal and External Examiners\nIncludes:\nnormal expectations; alternative arrangements; risks; duration of appointments\nNormally each research submission will be examined by one Internal Examiner who is a member of staff of the academic School at Nottingham to which the student belongs (or, if appropriate, a member of staff of another academic School), and one External Examiner who is a member of staff of another academic institution.\nAlternative arrangements (except that the examining board for any research submission must include at least one External Examiner) may be approved. For example, it is possible that in a small academic School there is no member of staff (apart from the supervisor who, of course, is disqualified from acting as an Examiner) with the expertise to act as Internal Examiner in the research area. The Head of School may reccomend that the submission be examined by two External Examiners, both of whom meet the published criteria for appointment, with a member of the internal staff acting as a co-ordinator of the examination proceedings.\nThe role of the coordinator will be to organise and operate the administrative arrangements for examination of the student's thesis and to facilitate the smooth-running of the viva voce examination.\nOne of the two External Examiners should be identified as the chair of the viva voce proceedings.\nAny cases where an individual examiner did not meet the published criteria for appointment should be considered by the Quality and Standards Committee.\nWhere a candidate has a contract of employment with the University of Nottingham, Schools should consider whether the appointment of an Internal Examiner would risk the introduction of the perception of bias into the examination process. Where such a risk is identified, Schools should always take the option of appointing two External Examiners.\nThe examiner appointments will last for the duration of the examination process, including re-submissions where this is the outcome of the first examination, unless exceptional circumstances arise.\n4. Role of examiners\nIncludes:\noverview; submission of independent report\nThe role of the Examiners is to consider whether the information, arguments and results of the student's research work as presented in the thesis and as defended in the viva voce examination (if appropriate) meet the academic standards relevant to the degree.\nThe Examiners are required to submit independent reports on the thesis, a joint report on the viva voce examination (if a viva voce examination is required by the regulations), and a joint recommendation regarding the award of the degree.\nFor more information about viva voce examinations, please consult the following:\nViva voce examinations\n5. Role of the Internal Examiner\nIncludes:\nparticipation in viva voce examination; student defence of work; responsibilities\nThe Internal Examiner must read the student's thesis and participate in the viva voce examination, and come to a view as to whether the student's research work and knowledge meet the standard which would normally be expected of a student in the School submitting for that degree, and the University's criteria for the award of the degree.\nThey will receive the PDF version of the examination copy of the thesis and where appropriate share this with the External Examiner, subject to the agreement of the supervisor(s).\nIn addition they should act as the facilitator of the administrative arrangements for the examination of the thesis and of the viva voce examination, including ensuring that any reasonable adjustments required for disabled students, including autistic spectrum conditions, disabilities, mental health difficulties, long-term health conditions, or specific learning differences are made. They should remind the External Examiner of the need to submit their independent report at least 3 working days before the viva, and also ensure that their own report is submitted at this time.  Independent reports should not be shared before submission.\nThey should seek to ensure that, during the viva voce examination, the student is given a fair opportunity to defend their work and that the External Examiner is aware of any extenuating circumstances which have a bearing on the student's case. Following a viva voce examination, the student should be given immediate informal feedback on the outcome of the examination and should be advised that more formal details will be transmitted later in writing. The Internal Examiner should also write to the student formally conveying the joint views of the Examiners on the submission, describing in detail the academic and presentational reasons for their recommendation, and (if appropriate) providing clear advice about what matters should be addressed in any resubmission.\nFor more information about viva voce examinations, please consult the following:\nViva voce examinations\nIf corrections have been recommended, the Internal Examiner will be responsible for checking these and confirming with Registry and Academic Affairs that these have been completed.\nThe Internal Examiner will be responsible for confirming that the final electronically submitted version of the work is that which has been approved by the Examiners if no corrections were needed after examination.\n6. Criteria for appointing Internal Examiner\nIncludes:\nresponsibility of Head of School; eligibility\nThe Head of School should ensure that the person nominated to act as Internal Examiner is a research-active member of the academic staff of the University who has the appropriate expertise in the student's research area. If Schools wish to recommend nominees who do not satisfy this criterion, this should be highlighted in the nomination form and a case provided for consideration by the Quality and Standards Committee (QSC).\nInternal Assessors who have been involved in the Progression Reviews may act as Internal Examiner if deemed appropriate by all parties, but it is not an expectation that they do so.\nPost-doctoral staff, Research Fellows below level 5, holders of honorary appointments who do not receive remuneration, Emeritus Professors, staff who do not hold a doctorate themselves and retired academic staff should not be permitted to act as Internal Examiners.\n7. Academic Staff in their first appointment\nIncludes:\nrecommendation of joint supervision; application to Quality and Standards Committee for permission\nAn academic member of staff in their first appointment at the University of Nottingham can be permitted to act as sole Internal Examiner on their first postgraduate research degree examination occasion, as long as they have previous UK doctoral or MPhil PGR examining experience. Where internal examiner has no previous UK experience, an Independent Chair should be appointed who should monitor and report on their conduct in the joint report.\nHowever, Heads of Schools may apply to the Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) for permission to allow such a member of academic staff to act as the sole Internal Examiner without an independent Chair, if a good case can be made that the member of staff's educational and professional background makes it appropriate for them to act in this capacity. For more information about QSC, please consult the following:\nQuality and Standards Committee\n8. Role of the External Examiner\nIncludes:\nrequirements; leading viva voce examination; judging standards\nThe External Examiner must read the student's thesis and should lead the viva voce examination.\nThe External Examiner must, in particular, come to a view as to whether the student's research work and knowledge are of a standard which are comparable to those of students being examined at other institutions for the same degree.\n9. Appointment of External Examiners\nIncludes:\nmembers of staff from outside institutions; nominating individuals from other suitable environments; eligibility; approval of nominations\nMembers of staff from outside institutions whom Schools wish to nominate to act as External Examiners for Nottingham research degrees should be research-active Professors, Readers, Lecturers or other teachers of their institution (or of equivalent status).\nHowever, it will be appropriate in some cases for Schools to nominate individuals from other suitable environments provided that those individuals are experts in the field of the student's topic of research and hold a professional status which is equivalent to a University Professor, Reader, Lecturer or teacher.\nIn order to assess the eligibility of any individual to act as External Examiner who has not previously acted in this capacity for the University of Nottingham, the Head of School should obtain a brief Curriculum Vitae which should be forwarded to Registry and Academic Affairs, Postgraduate Research Team or equivalent, with the nomination on the standard form. They will retain the Curriculum Vitae for future reference.\nNominations for Examiners will be approved by the University and Registry and Academic Affairs, the Postgraduate Research Team or equivalent, which will write to the External Examiners informing them of the terms and conditions of their appointment and their role as Examiners. The letter will include a request that the Examiner consider whether a potential conflict(s) of interest is likely to occur as a result of examining a candidate's thesis and if so, that they disclose it to the University.\n10. Ineligible categories for External Examiner\nIncludes:\nmembers of staff from other institutions; emeritus professors; retired academic staff\nA member of staff of another institution should not be invited to act as an External Examiner if they are a University of Nottingham graduate who graduated within the last three years. Also, ex-members of staff of Nottingham who left the University less than three years previously and holders of honorary appointments for which remuneration is given at the University of Nottingham should not be permitted to act as External Examiners.\nEmeritus Professors and academic staff who have been retired for more than three years should not be permitted to act as External Examiners unless it can be demonstrated that they continue to be research active.\n11. Disagreement between Examiners\nIncludes:\njoint decisions; when particular weight should be given\nIn the event of a disagreement on the appropriate outcome of a research degree examination between the Internal and External Examiner, the matter should be resolved by the Examiners on the basis of detailed argument about the specific academic points arising from the examination, and a joint decision should be reached.\nIn this circumstance particular weight should be given to the views of the External Examiner.\nWhere there are two External Examiners particular weight should be given to the chair.\n12. Role of the supervisor\nIncludes:\nscope; attendance; availability for viva voce examination\nMembers of the supervisory team may not act as Examiners for the student's submission.\nThe supervisor(s) may not normally attend the viva voce examination except with the agreement of the External Examiner, in which case they may attend as an observer only or where required under the terms of an approved collaborative doctorate programme, in which case they may contribute questions but may not participate in making the Examiners' recommendation.\nHowever, it is recommended that at least one member of the supervisory team, preferably the primary supervisor, should be available in the School at the time of the viva voce examination in case the Examiners feel that their presence at the report of the outcome of the viva voce is required (for example, to give support to the student in the event of major corrections or a referral).\n13. Role of the Head of School\nIncludes:\ninstructions for examiners\nThe Head of School must approve the appointment of the Examiners.\nInstructions for examiners:\nMRes and MA/MSc by research examination information\nMPhil examination guidance\nPhD-level examinations guidance\nForms\nIncludes:\nnomination of examiners\nForms:\nNomination of examiners form (PGR)\nNomination of examiners form (PGR)\nNomination of examiners form (PGR)\nAdditional guidance in 2020/21 due to Covid-19\nPlease be aware that the following guidance was developed and applied during academic year 2020/21 in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Assessment\n4.1\nCompensation cannot be offered for failure of any component within a module.\n4.2\nAll placement assessments are graded on a pass or fail basis.\n4.3\nWhere no formal extension has been agreed, a late submission will be deemed a failed submission.\n4.4\nAll placements are assessed by the trainee’s supervisor, Clinical Tutor and, where appropriate, Co-Director (Clinical Practice). Supervisor assessments for taught placements are regarded as recommendations to the Programme Directors with the final decision to pass or fail the placement made by the Board of Examiners.\n5. Reassessment opportunities\n5.1\nTrainees who have failed modules shall be offered one opportunity to be reassessed with the following\nexceptions:\n5.1.1\nTaught Modules\nTaught modules assessed by a Practice Based Learning Assessment (PBL): Only one PBL module may be reassessed. If a trainee fails one component or more of a second PBL module assessed by a PBL assessment, no further reassessment will be allowed and the trainee will not be permitted to continue on the\nprogramme.\n5.1.2\nPlacement\nModules\nPlacements are assessed by a combination of case studies (written and oral) and clinical assessments. Trainees will be permitted one opportunity to resit one placement module. If a trainee fails one component or more of a second placement module, no further reassessment will be permitted and the trainee will not be permitted to continue on the programme.\n(a)\nTrainees who require funding to re-sit a placement failed by the clinical assessment will need the agreement of\nNHS\nCommissioners to continue funding an extension of the trainee’s employment and studies during the course of the three-year programme (see\nbelow).\n(b)\nWhere a trainee requires an extension of the training contract, the University may be asked to confirm that the trainee is expected to satisfactorily complete and is suitable to work as a registered Clinical Psychologist, adhering to the expectations of\nNHS\nemployment\npractice.\n6. Boards of examiners\n6.1\nThe Board of Examiners shall have responsibility for assessment in respect of the taught elements of the programme (see programme structure in Annex A) which will feed into the considerations of the Programme Research Annual Review (RAR) panel which shall have responsibility for assessment of the research elements of the programme and for confirming a student’s entitlement to progression.\n6.2\nDetermination of a student’s entitlement to conferment of the final award shall be the responsibility of the Board of Examiners\n.\n6.3\nAll meetings of the Board of Examiners are deemed to be held jointly between the universities and no restrictions on the exchange of information shall apply.\n6.4\nIn recognition of the link between academic progression and employment status, the programme may communicate directly with trainees who are in danger of programme failure and thereby of losing their employment. The Programme Directors will have responsibility for informing trainees’ NHS employers of concerns about trainees’ employment status and programme failure.\n7. Progression\nIncludes: taught components; research components\n7.1 Taught components\n7.1.1\nIn order to progress through subsequent years, trainees shall have passed all the required elements of the taught modules at each stage of the programme.\n7.2 Research components\n7.1.1\nEach candidate will have at least two academic supervisors for the Research Modules that comprise the Research Project Portfolio.\n7.1.2\nProgress records shall be confirmed by Programme Research Annual Review (RAR) panels at least annually and make recommendations to the Board of Examiners.\n7.2.3\nUpon receipt of the progress record, the trainee transcript and any additional information that it has required, the RAR panel can recommend to the Board of Examiners that:\n(a)\nthe enrolment of the trainee shall continue or\n(b)\nthe enrolment of the trainee shall continue and the student must be reassessed in failed elements of the annual review\n(c)\nthe trainee’s course of studies be terminated and the award of the MSc in Applied Psychology be considered or\n(d)\nthe trainee’s course of studies be terminated and no award be made\n8. Submission of research project portfolio and examination\n8.1\nThe candidate shall submit a Research Project Portfolio for examination, which shall comprise of a draft journal paper, an extended paper (including an updated literature review and extended methods, analysis, results and discussion sections), a critical reflection and a poster.\n8.2\nThe Research Project Portfolio shall be of a standard to indicate the creation and interpretation of new knowledge through original research, which extends the forefront of the discipline. The work reported shall be of a quality to satisfy peer review and merit publication in a scientific journal.\n8.3\nCandidates will submit their Research Project Portfolios in February of their third year of training, to be examined viva voce by May that year. Candidates who miss the February deadline can only next submit their portfolio in June, to have their viva voce examination in September. Precise dates will be published at the beginning of each academic year. Candidates who submit after June will have their viva voce examination conducted in line with the timeframes specified in university regulations.\n9. Outcomes of portfolio examination\n9.1\nThe Examiners may recommend the following outcomes of examination for candidates:\nPass the research component of the degree\nPass the research component of the degree subject to minor corrections within one month\nPass the research component of the degree subject to minor amendments to be completed within three months\nRequire the candidate to attend for a second viva voce examination and resubmit the same portfolio (which may be subject to minor amendments to be completed within three months)\nRequire the candidate to resubmit the portfolio in a revised form within twelve months with or without attending a second viva voce examination\nFail the research component of the degree with no further opportunity for resubmission.\n10.

These regulations can be accessed via:\nUniversity of Lincoln - Extenuating Circumstances\nExtensions and Extenuating Circumstances Policy\nAs Health Service professional and full-time NHS employees, trainees have an obligation to be aware of any impairment to their fitness to work. This extends to academic work and the completion of assessments and assignments. If the submission of any assignment is likely to be adversely affected through illness or other significant personal circumstances outside their control, trainees must ask for an extension in advance of the submission date using the Extension Request Form.\nExtensions of up to two weeks can be agreed by the module convenor/module co- ordinator.\nExtensions of more than two weeks require the approval of the Co-director (Practice Learning) for Clinical Practice Reports or of the Co-director (Academic and Research) for all other assignments.\nTrainees who require a prolonged extension would normally be required to interrupt their studies.\nWhere trainees are aware of a disability or long-term medical condition, or other circumstances that are expected to have an impact on their performance in assessment, they should make their Personal Tutor aware of their disability or long-term medical condition at the earliest possible opportunity so that appropriate arrangements can be put in place.\nWhere trainees are aware of circumstances beyond their control that might adversely affect the submission of their Research Project Portfolio, they should inform their academic supervisor at the earliest opportunity, so that alternative hand-in dates can be agreed.\nClaims for extenuating circumstances after the submission date for an assignment has passed would normally raise a concern about the trainee’s fitness to practise, as they should have been aware of their impaired performance and requested an extension. In such a case, the module convenor / module co-ordinator would normally complete a Concern Form (see Fitness to Practise Procedure). Trainees who wish claim extenuating circumstances should complete and sign the relevant form and submit it to the Extenuating Circumstances Panel of the University of Lincoln.\nThe Extenuating Circumstances Panel will consider the claim and supporting documentation at their next regular meeting and determine whether extenuating circumstances obtain and whether the trainee’s reasons for not having sought an extension are valid. The Extenuating Circumstances Panel will communicate its decision to the Chair of the Trent DClinPsy Board of Examiners. The decision whether to allow a resubmission of an assignment because of extenuating circumstances rests with the Board of Examiners.\nAnnex C - Fitness to practise\nThe Fitness to Practise regulations of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at the University of Nottingham shall apply to this programme, subject to the following adjustments:\nThe term ‘trainee’ shall be used throughout in preference to that of ‘student’.\nConcerns that a trainee may not be fit to practise Clinical Psychology shall be made to the Programme Co-Director at the trainee’s degree-awarding university.\nReferences to ‘the head of studies’ shall be read as referring to the relevant Programme Co-Director.\nIn the section headed ‘Investigations’, the reference to “the University’s Occupational Health Service” shall be read as referring to the trainee’s employer’s Occupational Health Service.\nThese regulations can be accessed via:\nRegistration, attendance and study\nThe current form of the regulations, as they apply to the programme are as follows: Fitness to Practise Procedure\n1.   Initiation of the Procedure\n1.1.\nAny concerns that a trainee may have acted in such a way or may suffer from a health problem which may render that trainee a person not fit to be admitted to and practise Clinical Psychology should be disclosed to the Programme Co- Director at the trainee’s degree awarding university.\n1.2.\nThe disclosure should normally be made in writing using the concern form. In cases where the initial disclosure is not in the concern form format e.g. notification of criminal conviction, then the relevant Co-director should ensure that a concern form containing the disclosure is completed. The person making the disclosure must identify themselves; disclosures which are raised anonymously will not normally be considered. In exceptional circumstances the discloser’s identity may be permitted to remain confidential.\n1.3.\nThe raising of a concern form does not usually indicate a fitness to practise issue. However, the existence of multiple concern forms may show a pattern which does indicate a fitness to practise issue. Therefore on the receipt of an individual concern form which on its own does not raise a fitness to practise issue the Co- directors, should jointly review whether other concern forms have been raised, which when all considered together raise issues regarding the trainee’s fitness to practise, e.g. professional behaviour.\n1.4.\nWhere there are concerns that are serious then a trainee may be excluded from clinical placements by their Clinical Tutor on advice of the Co-directors. Some examples of a serious concern would include, but not as an exclusive list, situations where:\npatients may be placed at risk or;\nthe profession might be brought into disrepute by the public knowing that the trainee remained in a clinical environment or;\nthat a trainee’s conduct was deemed to be disruptive to the delivery of clinical care or clinical teaching  in a partner, usually NHS, organisation.\nConcerns may be such that trainees can be suspended from their course with immediate effect by the Dean or by the head of studies. If this decision is based on a concern related to discipline or health and safety then appropriate procedures as set out within the Code of Discipline for Students and the Quality Manual should be followed.\nIf trainees are allowed to return from suspension, they will be expected to comply with any conditions decided by the School or imposed as part of the outcome of any other procedure.\n1.5.\nA trainee will not be allowed to graduate from either University if they are subject to a fitness to practise investigation or hearing which has not been completed.\n2.\nInvestigations\n2.1.\nOn receipt of a disclosure which gives rise to a fitness to practise concern, the relevant Co-director shall promptly, and normally within 5 working days, arrange for the matter to be investigated and shall notify the trainee of the following:\nThe basis of the concerns and any allegations against them.\nThe identity of the investigating\nofficer.\nAny limitations or conditions placed upon the continuance of studies or supervised practice during the period of the\ninvestigation.\n2.2\nThe trainee can register an objection to the appointment of the investigating officer on the basis of a lack of impartiality. Such an objection needs to the relevant Co-director within 5 working days. Examples would include where the investigating officer has initially raised the concern e.g. probity issues, or where the investigating officer has had interaction with the trainee on an unrelated contentious issue. If this objection is upheld a new investigating officer should be appointed.\n2.3\nThe investigating officer may request members of staff connected with the\ncase to provide written comments on the trainee’s conduct and/or health, explaining why there is concern as to fitness to practise. Factual information about the trainee’s professional progress on the course and any other relevant documentation should also be\nprovided.\n2.4.\nThe investigating officer shall interview relevant individuals including the trainee themselves. At such interviews the investigating officer shall be accompanied by an assistant who shall prepare a written note of the\ninterview\n2.5.\nThe investigating officer should ensure that the trainee is advised of appropriate pastoral support mechanisms within their University and Trainees’\nUnion.\n2.6.\nThe trainee is entitled to have a person of their choosing attend the interview with them in order to support them at the meeting. The trainee should\nconfirm the name and status of the person accompanying them in writing to the Investigating Officer in advance of the interview. The person supporting the trainee is not attending the interview as an advocate or character witness.\n2.7.\nThe trainee may be required to attend their employer’s Occupational Health Service in order that advice on his or her fitness to practise on medical grounds may be sought. In cases where there is evidence of recurring health problems or with addictive behaviours, Occupational health referral is\nrequired.\n2.8.\nSave in exceptional circumstances, the investigating officer shall, no later than 15 working days after the referral by the Co-directors, make a written report of the results of the investigation to the Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at The University of Nottingham detailing all evidence obtained. From this point onwards all further stages of the Fitness to Practise Procedure are handled by the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at The University of Nottingham.\n3.  Referral to Fitness to Practise\nCommittee\n3.1\nPromptly on receipt of the report from the investigating officer, and in any event within 5 working days, the Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences shall consult the Dean of the Faculty who will determine, in the light of the seriousness of the matter and the strength of the evidence, whether the case should be referred to the Fitness to Practise\nCommittee.\n3.2\nThe Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences will notify the trainee in writing of the\nfollowing.\nThe outcome of the investigation and the Dean’s\ndecision.\nWhether\nthe\nmatter\nis\nto\nbe\nreferred\nto\nthe\nFitness\nto\nPractise\nCommittee together with full details of the procedures to be\nadopted.\nThe imposition of any conditions/limitations placed on the trainee’s\nstudies.\n3.3\nIn the event that the Fitness to Practise Committee is to be convened, the Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences will notify the trainee\nof the identity of the Committee members and the date of the proposed meeting of the Committee and make available to him/her, all of the evidence detailed in the investigating officer’s\nreport.\n3.4\nThe trainee shall be allowed at least 15 working days in which to prepare his/her case.

This person will then not be able to be a member of the Committee and another member will need to be appointed.\n6.   Procedure for the conduct of the meeting\nThis section is a guide to the conduct of the meeting itself. The Chair has discretion to vary these arrangements as they think fit.\n6.1\nPrior to the meeting the Secretary to the Committee will ensure the trainee has copies of all documents circulated to members of the Committee and is aware of the procedures to be\nfollowed.\n6.2\nThe Chair will ask if any member has been personally involved in the trainee's case at any prior stage and, if so, will ask them to withdraw from the\nmeeting.\n6.3\nThe\ntrainee,\nthe\nfriend\n(if\nattending)\nand\nstaff\nwill\nthen\njoin\nthe\nCommittee.\n6.4\nThe\nChair\nwill\nintroduce\nby\nname\nand explain\nthe\nfunctions\nof\nthe\nmembers\nof\nthe Committee, the staff, and any others\npresent.\n6.5\nThe Chair will explain the powers of the Committee, as set out in\nsection7.\n6.6\nThe Chair will invite the investigating officer (or nominee) to make an opening statement and then invite the Committee to ask questions.

Its content is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Overview\nThis document sets out the general principles and regulations that apply to the Trent Doctorate in Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy) - a professional doctoral-training programme delivered jointly by the Universities of Lincoln and Nottingham and delivered in Partnership with NHS England (previously HEE). These Regulations supersede all previous Regulations for the DClinPsy (which are hereby revoked) and represent the primary regulatory framework for the DClinPsy programme. Where a policy, procedure, or process is not specified below, the regulations governing Professional Doctorates at the Universities of Lincoln and Nottingham shall apply.\n1. Programme purpose, structure and awards\n1.1\nThe DClinPsy is a three-year postgraduate doctoral training programme. Graduates from the DClinPsy training are able to register with the Health Care Professions Council (HCPC) as practitioner psychologists, can use the protected title Clinical Psychologist, and can gain Chartership with the British Psychological Society (BPS).\n1.2\nStudents on the DClinPsy programme are called 'trainees'.\n1.3\nTrainees formally enrol with both Universities but are designated a base University at the point of their placement offer. Placement offers are dependent upon allocation of the trainee to a specific Healthcare Trust and trainees are made aware of their assigned Trust and base University prior to the point of enrolment.\n1.4\nProgramme structure\nThe programme is structured according to the following principles:\n180 credits of taught provision\n90 credits of placement/taught provision\n270 credits of research project provision comprising three research modules including the production of a Research Project Portfolio\n1.5\nDoctoral Award\n1.5.1\nUpon successful completion of the programme trainees will be awarded their degree from the base university and shall not be eligible for a degree from the other University with which they are enrolled.\n1.5.2\nThe DClinPsy degree is awarded as a Pass.\n1.5.3\nThe degree of DClinPsy will be conferred on trainees who have fulfilled all programme requirements.\n2. Accreditation of prior learning\n2.1\nThere is no Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL, APEL, Recognition of Other Learning) for entry to the programme.\n3. Assessment and progression\n3.1\nThere is no compensation between assessment elements or modules.\n3.2\nA late submission without an approved extension will be counted as a non-submission.\n3.3\nTaught Components\n3.3.1\nIn order to progress to subsequent years, trainees shall have passed all elements of the taught modules at each stage of the programme.\n3.3.2\nIf a trainee fails a taught assessment element, they will be offered a single in-year re-sit opportunity for that assessment element. Failure of a re-sit will result in programme failure.\n3.3.3\nWhere students reach a progression point but have outstanding first-sit or resit opportunities, the Board of Examiners shall permit “proceed with conditions” to the next level of study pending completion of the outstanding elements. A Board decision on progression or withdrawal will be made at the next available Monthly Board.\n3.4\nClinical Placements\n3.4.1\nA trainee is only entitled to a single resit opportunity against one failed clinical placement. Failure in a second clinical placement will result in programme failure.\n3.4.2\nClinical placements may be assessed via single or multiple clinical placement modules. Where a placement is assessed by two modules, the first module constitutes a prerequisite for the second. Failing of the pre-requisite module constitutes a failure of the whole clinical placement.\n3.4.3\nA Trainee who fails the prerequisite clinical placement module and although they are not able to be assessed in the second module for that placement may continue to engage in the second element of this placement as part of their employment contract. This may be subject to Fitness to Practice Regulations.\n3.4.4\nWhere a trainee has to re-sit a clinical placement, the Exam Board has the discretion to allow trainees to proceed to the next year and participate in the academic programme pending formal progression.\n3.4.5\nWhere a trainee requires an extension to their training contract, which impacts upon the duration of study, the Board of Examiners can extend the duration of studies subject to confirmation of the trainee’s employment extension and accompanying conditions.\n3.5\nResearch Components\n3.5.1\nEach trainee’s progress will be monitored and confirmed by the Research Annual Review (RAR) Panel who meet annually.\n3.5.2\nThe RAR panel can recommend to the Board of Examiners either that:\n3.5.2.1\nthe trainee can progress,\n3.5.2.2\nthe trainee must be reassessed in failed elements but can proceed (continue with their studies),\n3.5.2.3\nthe trainee’s course of studies be terminated.\n3.5.3\nIf a trainee fails a research assessment element in the first two research modules, they will be offered an in-year re-sit opportunity for that assessment element. Failure of a re-sit will result in programme failure.\n4. Research project portfolio\n4.1\nTrainees will be offered two submission points for their Research Project Portfolio. Trainees who submit their Research Project Portfolio in February of their third year of training will be examined by viva voce by May that year. Trainees who miss the February deadline can only next submit their portfolio in June, to have their viva voce examination in September. Precise dates will be published at the beginning of each academic year.\n4.2\nTrainees who are authorised to submit after June will have their viva voce examination conducted in line with the timeframes specified in university regulations.\n4.3\nThe Examiners may recommend the following outcomes of examination for Trainees:\n4.3.1\nPass the research component of the degree\n4.3.2\nPass the research component of the degree subject to minor corrections within one month\n4.3.3\nPass the research component of the degree subject to minor amendments to be completed within three months\n4.3.4\nRequire the trainee to attend for a second viva voce examination and resubmit the same portfolio (which may be subject to minor amendments to be completed within three months)\n4.3.5\nRequire the trainee to resubmit the portfolio in a revised form within twelve months with or without attending a second viva voce examination\n4.3.6\nFail the research component of the degree with no further opportunity for resubmission\n5. Reassessment\n5.1\nResits will normally be submitted within 6 weeks of formal notification to the trainee of assessment failure.\n5.2\nAll trainee resits and other progression issues will normally be dealt with at the next available monthly board regardless of its primary remit.\n6. Board of examiners and exceptions to confidentiality\n6.1\nAll meetings of the Board of Examiners are deemed to be held jointly between the two partner universities and no restrictions on the exchange of information shall apply.\n6.2\nIn recognition of the link between academic progression and employment status, there are three exceptions to the confidentiality and communication of exam board results:\n6.2.1\nthe programme may communicate directly with trainees who are in danger of programme failure and thereby of losing their employment.\n6.2.2\nThe Programme Directors will have responsibility for informing trainees’ NHS employers of concerns about trainees’ employment status and programme failure.\n6.2.3\nThe programme will normally communicate directly with the HCPC and other accrediting bodies directly following an Award Board, giving names of trainees who have successfully completed all components of the DClinPsy to allow immediate registration as Clinical Psychologists.\n7. Academic offences and misconduct\n7.1\nThe Academic Offences Policy of the trainee’s degree awarding University shall apply to this programme.\n8. Extensions\n8.1\nWhere leave in relation to sickness has been given by the NHS manager, an extension of equal duration for assignment deadlines will normally be given.\n8.2\nWhere leave in relation to a period of approved Interruption to Studies has been given by the University of Nottingham or the University of Lincoln, an extension of equal duration for assignment deadlines will normally be given.\n8.3\nNotwithstanding the above, all trainees must submit extension requests to the University of Lincoln with supporting documentation, which may include a PASS/Learning Support plan.\n9. Mitigating circumstances\n9.1\nAll trainees are subject to Mitigating Circumstances process at the University of Lincoln.\n9.2\nTrainees who apply for Mitigating Circumstances that have affected, are affecting or will affect their Fitness to Practice have a duty to inform the programme team and their employing service as soon as possible.\n10.

        "content": "Policy on circumstances affecting students' ability to study and complete assessments - The University of NottinghamPolicy on circumstances affecting students' ability to study and complete assessments\nThis page contains the University's policy on circumstances affecting students' ability to study and complete assessments. Its content is applicable to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Please be aware that during academic year 2019/20, the University introduced exceptional regulations in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. These were campus specific and meant to be read in conjunction with all pre-existing content.\nFrom the beginning of academic year 2021/22, the active application of the exceptional regulations affecting this page has now ceased, with the sole exception of those which cover extenuating circumstances at the University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM). The following will remain active at UNM until further notice in light of the current situation in Malaysia:\nCovid-19 EC Exceptional Regulations - UNM\nExceptional Guidance to Extenuating Circumstances Panels\nAny outcomes from the application of the regulations during academic years 2019/20 and 2020/21 across all three campuses will, however, continue to be honoured and used in all decisions regarding those affected.\nFurther details about those regulations which have NOT been extended into academic year 2021/22 can be found in the \"Exceptional regulations applied in response to Covid-19\" section below.\nPurpose\nDuring their study students may encounter significant personal difficulties that are outside their control and impact on their ability to study and/or complete assessments.\nThe Policy on circumstances affecting students’ ability to study and complete assessments provides mechanisms by which students may bring circumstances having a detrimental impact on their study to the attention of the University.\nThe policy and associated procedures allow for the consideration of the impact of those circumstances on their academic performance and the provision of measures to address the impact, where possible and appropriate.\n1. Principles\nIncludes:\ncriteria; application\nIn order to be considered under this policy, such difficulties must meet all of the following criteria:\nThey must be out of the student’s control – the student could not have prevented them.\nThey must have had a significant impact – they must have had a demonstrably negative impact on the student’s ability to study or to undertake an assessment.\nThe timing of the circumstances must be relevant to the claimed impact.\nThe appropriate management of circumstances affecting students’ study and assessment is significant in ensuring that academic standards are maintained and that students are treated fairly.\nThis policy is applicable to all types of student on all programmes or courses.\n2. Types of circumstance\nTwo types of circumstances may affect student performance in study and/or assessment:\n(a)\nLong term conditions/disabilities including Specific Learning Differences, such as dyslexia, dyspraxia, and ADHD, a recognised disability and/or long-term health condition, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and mental health difficulties. For more information, please consult the following:\nPolicy on long-term conditions or disabilities affecting students' ability to study and complete assessments\nStudents with Support Plans have access to coursework extensions\nThe thesis pending period (including Policy on extensions)\nVoluntary interruption of study\n(b)\nShorter term circumstances such as a self-limiting illness which require consideration as and when they arise and may affect study and/or assessment. For more information, please consult the following:\nExtenuating circumstances regulation\nThe thesis pending period (including Policy on extensions)\n3. Responsibilities of Schools/Departments\ni.\nSchools should ensure that all students are aware of this policy and associated procedures. As a minimum they are expected to include information in their initial induction packs and remind students each year of its existence. This may be done by inclusion in the School/Programme Handbook. Assessment level information (e.g. opt out of ‘no evidence’ extensions) needs to be included in module handbooks (so information is at module level for joint honours students).\nii.\nEach School should ensure that students are aware of primary contacts for submission of claims and should ensure that advice about possible outcomes/consequences is easily available to students. There may be times when a School will need to respond to students in a short timeframe so their procedures must support the ability to do this.\niii.\nSchools should ensure that their Personal Tutors are aware of this policy, associated procedures and their responsibility, if appropriate, to support and advise their tutees when they know of their intention to submit a claim.\niv.\nSchools should consider and respond to claims in accordance with the associated procedures.\n4. Responsibilities of students\ni.\nStudents are responsible for ensuring that they inform the University promptly of any circumstances that they consider are affecting their ability to study and/or undertake assessments. With early warning of a problem, the University can provide appropriate support. Students should be aware that the University cannot respond to a student's circumstances if they remain unaware of relevant information.\nii.\nWhere possible, students should contact their Personal Tutor, Support and Wellbeing Officer (UNUK), Disability Liaison Officer (UNNC) or other appropriate staff member in advance of engaging with associated procedures, so that they may receive guidance and support in these processes.\niii.\nStudents are expected to observe timeframes for the submission of claims defined in procedures associated with this policy.\niv.\nStudents are responsible for obtaining and providing the required evidence demonstrating their claimed circumstances. The University will not seek documentary evidence on a student’s behalf.\nv.\nStudents should make every effort to ensure that they are fit to study and undertake assessment, and where a student feels that there are circumstances that are affecting them adversely it is their responsibility to seek advice and professional help, where relevant, to assist in resolving the problem.\nvi.\nStudents are responsible for ensuring that they are available for all necessary study and assessment. A student will be in breach of the University’s attendance and engagement requirements if they do not attend an examination or comply with a coursework deadline and do not submit an appropriately evidenced claim in accordance with one of the procedures associated with this policy.\nFor more information about the University's Regulations governing attendance and engagement, please consult the following:\nRegulations governing attendance and engagement\nvii.\nStudents should use the policy and procedures reasonably and only for circumstances with a genuine, significant and demonstrable negative impact\n5. Responsibilities of personal tutors\ni.\nPersonal Tutors should support students making submissions related to the procedures associated with this policy, as appropriate.\nii.\nIf they have previously been made aware of circumstances affecting a student’s ability to study and/or complete assessments and believe those circumstances to have had an adverse impact on the student’s performance, at the student’s request, Personal Tutors should provide a statement as per the evidence requirements of associated procedures.\niii.\nPersonal Tutors should direct students to professional support for their circumstances and/or direct them to and help them navigate through University processes and procedures, and/or provide other appropriate support.\niv.\nPersonal tutors must ensure their knowledge of these policies is current and provide advice within the parameters of published policies and procedures.\n6. Responsibilities of Support and Wellbeing Officers\ni.\nSupport and Wellbeing Officers (UNUK) or Senior Disability Support Advisor (UNNC) should provide help and guidance to students in relation to their health and wellbeing within the parameters of published policies and procedures. They will direct students to professional support for their circumstances and/or direct them to and help them navigate through University processes and procedures, and/or provide other appropriate support.\nii.\nSupport and Wellbeing Officers (UNUK) or Senior Disability Support Advisor (UNNC) should support students making submissions related to the procedures associated with this policy. Often this will be part of a wider package of support provided to an individual student.\niii.\nIf they have previously been made aware of circumstances affecting a student’s ability to study and/or complete assessments and believe those circumstances to have had an adverse impact on the student’s performance, at the student’s request, Support and Wellbeing Officers (UNUK), or Senior Disability Support Advisor (UNNC) should provide a statement as per the evidence requirements of associated procedures.\niv.\nSupport and Wellbeing Officers (UNUK), or Senior Disability Support Advisor (UNNC) will attend and advise extenuating circumstances panels on student cases, but are not a member of the panel and are not part of the decision-making process.\nv.\nSupport and Wellbeing Officers (UNUK), or Senior Disability Support Advisor (UNNC) may meet with students to explore support relevant to the issues identified in the claims the student has submitted.\n7. Responsibilities of Student Services staff (UNUK) or Faculty Office staff (UNNC)\ni.\nStaff will offer support, information and direction to relevant procedures and specialist services.  Guidance provided will be within the parameters of published policies and procedures.\nii.\nStaff will receive, log and process for consideration claims submitted by students. Staff will keep complete records of all claims and ensure that they manage and note extensions to deadlines and deferrals of examination such that relevant University offices are informed of the later assessment.\niii.\nStaff will notify students of the outcome of their claims and update student records accordingly.\niv.\nStaff will attend meetings of local extenuating circumstances panels to ensure records are kept and due process is followed.\nv.\nStaff will review outcomes of claims, provide data and highlight inconsistent or incorrect application of process or outcomes with the relevant Head of School/Department and, if appropriate, with Faculty Teaching and Learning Committees (UNUK), or Faculty Education and Student Experience Committee (UNNC).\n8. Guidance on acceptable and unacceptable circumstances\nGuidance on types of circumstance and whether they might be considered as good cause for failing to comply with an assessment requirement is provided in each associated procedure.\n9. Ongoing circumstances\nWhere a student has had circumstances that affect their ability to study and/or take assessments for one period accepted but continues to be affected by or has a recurrence of the same circumstances, they should seek medical/other advice. If necessary, they should either refer to the Policy on long-term conditions or disabilities affecting students’ ability to study and complete assessments so that appropriate support for study or individual arrangements for examinations can be put in place or discuss with their School/Department the possibility of voluntarily interrupting their studies until the circumstances have been resolved.\nFurther information regarding ongoing circumstances can also be found in the extenuating circumstances procedure.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nPolicy on long-term conditions or disabilities affecting students' ability to study and complete assessments\nVoluntary interruption of study\nExtenuating circumstances procedure\nExtenuating circumstances regulation\n10. Formal complaint\nIf a student has made, or is making, a complaint under the Student Complaint Procedure and feels that the matters covered by that complaint may have affected their assessment performance, they should make the School/Department aware in writing of their complaint such that it can be taken into account if appropriate.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nStudent Complaint Procedure\nPolicy on student complaints\n11. Timescales\nTimescales for submissions of claims will be published within the relevant procedure and must be adhered to.\nThe timescales are deemed to be reasonable and allow students adequate opportunity to notify the University of circumstances affecting their ability to study and/or complete assessments.\n12. Evidence\nIncludes:\nreasons for rejection\nAll claims made under this policy must be supported by evidence/documentation as required in each procedure, except where explicitly permitted otherwise.\nClaims will be rejected if appropriate evidence is not included at the point of submission or provided within the relevant permissible timescales.\n13. Confidentiality of evidence\nConfidential information will only be shared within the University for the purposes of implementing this policy in a fair and rigorous manner. Any student wishing to restrict the sharing of such information should make their wishes known to the appropriate members of staff, preferably in writing.\nNormally such wishes will be respected unless to do so would be against the best interests of the University community or the interests of safety or security of any person.\nData protection principles will be observed at all times and records of claims will be kept in accordance with the University’s records retention schedule.\n14. Informing students of outcomes\nRegistry and Academic Affairs (UNUK) or Faculty Office (UNNC) should inform students of the outcomes of claims in writing according to the relevant procedure in a timely and reasonable manner.\n15.

Where academic policies and immigration policies seem to be contradictory, immigration policies will take precedence. For more information, please consult the following:\nImmigration sponsorship\n1.0 Purpose\nThis page sets out the University's regulation and procedure for students withdrawing on the grounds of health and safety.\nIn circumstances where there is serious concern about an individual's physical and/or mental welfare, the University will take all reasonable steps to provide help and support to the student. However, in some exceptional circumstances, it may be inappropriate to allow a student to continue with their studies, and the University has the right to require the individual to withdraw on the grounds of health and safety.\nIn addition, please be aware of the following:\nThe University's approach in all matters where there is a question of continuing attendance at the University through behaviour, performance or health, is to be thoughtful, measured and supportive\nConcerns surrounding the health and safety of other students and staff are also central to the decision-making process\nThis process is intended to allow for every opportunity to resolve difficulties by negotiation\nIt is expected that a decision to require a student to withdraw will be exceptional\nIt is expected also that the individual will be encouraged at every stage to make use of specialist support services available within the University\nWhere it is alleged that a student has committed an offence against the Code of Discipline for Students, the matter will normally be dealt with through disciplinary procedures.For more information on the code of discipline for students, please consult the link below.\n2.0 Roles and responsibilities\nThe Senate will appoint a Special Committee to deal with recommendations that a student will be required to withdraw either temporarily or permanently on grounds of health and safety will consist of:\nA senior member of the University appointed by the Senate as Chair of the Committee\nTwo members of Senate nominated by the Vice-Chancellor\nTwo full-time registered students nominated by the Students’ Union on the recommendation of the Welfare Officer\nThe presence of student representatives will be subject to the explicit consent of the student facing a recommendation. There will be no student members if the student facing a recommendation so requests.\nThe Registrar will appoint a member of staff to act as Secretary to the Committee and will appoint an Investigating Officer to make the case that a recommendation to suspend or exclude be upheld.\n2.1 Where matters have not been resolved and cannot be dealt with as a disciplinary matter\nWhere there are concerns about a student and the difficulties have not been resolved within the student’s home school, and the matter cannot appropriately be dealt with as a disciplinary matter, the Registrar may make a recommendation that a student be required to withdraw, either temporarily or permanently, from the University, or from some part of it. The Registrar may draw upon such professional/specialist advice as necessary in making a recommendation. The recommendation will be presented to a Special Committee of Senate appointed under this procedure.\nIn any case where the Registrar is of the view that the student is to be suspended or excluded immediately, pending a decision of the Special Committee, he may do that by exercising powers under Section XXIV(2) of the University Ordinances.\n3.0 Procedural steps\n1.\nIf a school has serious concerns about an individual student's health or safety, the member of staff with primary responsibility (for example, the tutor or supervisor) must in the first instance discuss the difficulties with the student. The concerns must be clearly identified and appropriate support offered if possible. The content and outcome of the meeting must be recorded and the record retained by the school for the duration of the student's course.\nAt any point in this process, the tutor or other member of staff may seek advice and guidance from the Director of Registry and Academic Affairs or a member of the University Health Service, including advice on personal matters which the student has given consent for them to discuss, as well as advice on referrals to University services.\n2.\nIf the situation is not resolved satisfactorily by this discussion, a further meeting may be convened with the student involving the Head of School (or their nominee). The content and outcome of the meeting must be recorded and the record retained by the school for the duration of the student’s course.\n3.\nIf the situation remains unresolved, the matter must be referred to the Registrar (and the Director of Registry and Academic Affairs notified). On receipt of a report from the Head of School detailing any steps taken in steps 1 and 2 and setting out the circumstances of the case (including matters occurring since the meeting referenced in step 2), if the Registrar is satisfied that a\nprima facie case exists for the student to be required to withdraw from the University, the case will be referred by them for consideration to a Special Committee of Senate and/or (in the case of a recommendation for immediate suspension or exclusion) exercise powers under Section XXIV (2) of the University Ordinances.\nIn cases of urgency, the Registrar and Vice-Chancellor may act notwithstanding that some or all of the elements under steps 1 to 3 have not been taken.\n4.\nWhere concerns about an individual student arise elsewhere than in a School, the Residential Experience Manager (for residential accommodation), the Chief Security Officer or another member of the University staff must make a report to the student's Head of School and the Director of Registry and Academic Affairs so that appropriate action may be taken in line with steps 1 to 3.\n5.\nUnder the provisions of Section XXIV (2) of the University Ordinances, the Vice-Chancellor, the Registrar or a Pro-Vice Chancellor (PVC) acting on the Vice-Chancellor’s behalf may suspend or exclude any student from any part of the University pending a decision by a Special Committee of Senate.\n3.1 Special committee of Senate\n1.\nThe Senate will appoint a Special Committee to deal with recommendations that a student will be required to withdraw either temporarily or permanently on grounds of health and safety, as detailed in 2.0 Roles and responsibilities.\n2.\nThe members of the Committee will be selected to ensure that any persons who have had any direct connection with the case or with the student concerned are excluded.\n3.\nThe student may object to any member of the Committee chosen to hear their case on giving reasons for supposing that member not to be impartial. The validity or otherwise of the objection will be determined by the Chair of the Committee, or by the Registrar where the objection is made about the Chair of the Committee. If a committee member is excluded following an objection, an additional member will be nominated by the Vice-Chancellor or the Students' Union, as appropriate.\n4.\nThe Committee reserves the right to seek specialist mental health advice when considering the case.\n5.\nThe Committee will convene a formal hearing, at which the student has the right to be accompanied by a friend or adviser. Students with a disability may also be accompanied by a support worker (for example, a sign language interpreter or mental health worker) as appropriate to their needs.\n6.\nThe student has the right to not attend a hearing. In all such circumstances, a representative of the student may attend on their behalf to present their case.\n7.\nThe Committee may in its discretion conduct or conclude a hearing in the absence of the student if, for example, the student fails to attend the hearing after all reasonable effort has been made to invite them. In such circumstances, the Committee will take steps to ensure that the process continues in a fair manner.\n8.\nThe Investigating Officer will provide the Committee with a written case supporting the recommendation to suspend or exclude the student.\n9.\nThe student facing any recommendation will be given both a copy of the case to uphold the suspension/exclusion and notice in writing of the date and time of the committee meeting to allow time to prepare their case. They will be given a copy of the Rules of Procedure governing the meeting, which will include information about the right to be represented or accompanied at a meeting and to present medical or other relevant evidence.\n10.\nThe Special Committee of Senate has the power to confirm or not to confirm a recommendation to require a student to withdraw temporarily or permanently from the University on the grounds of health and safety under the provisions of University Ordinances Section XV (20).\n3.2 Rules of procedure for the conduct of a formal Special Committee of Senate hearing\n1.\nThe Committee (with the Committee Secretary) will meet briefly in private to discuss procedure and ensure that there are no conflicts of interest. If the Committee is to hear oral testimony, the student, their representative, the Investigating Officer and any other University representative(s) with information relevant to the case will be asked to convene in a waiting area.\nAt the start of the meeting, the Chair will introduce everyone present, explain their roles and outline the procedure which will be followed.\nThe Chair will also confirm that the student and/or their representative has received all of the documentation and, if not accompanied, was aware of their right to bring a representative and therefore had chosen to waive that right.\nThe Chair must also confirm that the Investigating Officer has received any documentation submitted to the Committee by the student.\n2.\nThe Chair will invite the Investigating Officer to make a brief opening statement, and will then invite the Committee to ask questions. If other University representatives are present, they will be afforded the same opportunity to make a statement, and may themselves be questioned.\n3.\nThe Chair will invite the student or their representative to make a brief opening statement and will then invite the Committee to ask questions.\n4.\nAt each stage the Chair has discretion to allow reciprocal questioning by the various parties.\n5.\nThe Chair will ask the Investigating Officer and any other University representative(s), in turn, and finally the student (or the student’s representative) if they wish to make any closing statement and if they are satisfied that they have had a full opportunity to explain their case to the Committee.\n6.\nThe student, their representative, the Investigating Officer and any other University representative(s) will withdraw while the Committee considers its decision.\n7.\nAny decision will be communicated to both the student and School in writing within two working days.\n8.\nIn all cases, a record of the proceedings must be kept and the student provided with a copy.\n3.3 Powers of the Special Committee of Senate\n1.\nThe Committee will determine whether a student is required to withdraw permanently, or temporarily until certain specified conditions have been met, or for a specified period (with or without a requirement to meet conditions). The student will be informed in writing of the decision and its reasoning.\n2.\nAny exclusion that is not on a permanent basis will be subject to periodic review in the light of developments and any written representations made by the student or anyone acting on their behalf. Such a review would include medical evidence from the individual's medical practitioner, and would also allow for assessment from the University's own appointed medical specialists. Any such representations must be made in writing to the Registrar.\n3.\nA student may appeal in writing against the Committee's decision within seven working days of receipt of written confirmation of that decision. Any suspension or exclusion will remain in place for the duration of the appeal and for any further period during which the matter is under consideration by a Special Committee of Senate.\n4.\nAn appeal against a decision of a Special Committee of Senate will be to a nominated Pro-Vice Chancellor (PVC) and can only be made on the following grounds:\nThat there was a procedural irregularity that resulted in unfairness to the student.\nThat the decision of the committee was manifestly unreasonable.\nThat there is fresh evidence or evidence which was for good cause not presented to the Special Committee of Senate and which might reasonably have resulted in a different decision.\n5.\nThe PVC may disallow the appeal or refer the matter back to the same or a new Special Committee of Senate for further consideration.\n3.4 Further steps\nA student who has had their appeal rejected at this or an earlier stage can request a completion of procedures letter and put their case to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA).\nFor more information about the OIA, please consult the Office of the Independent Adjudicator\n4.0 Related regulations, policies and procedures\nOffice of the Independent Adjudicator\nImmigration sponsorship\nCode of Discipline for Students\n5.0 Version control table\nVersion Control Table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nReformatted to align with the new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework, based on content last modified on 5th April 2022\nQSC\nAugust 2024\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n04 September 2024||"

Where academic policies and immigration policies seem to be contradictory, immigration policies will take precedence. For more information, please consult the following:\nImmigration sponsorship\n1.0 Purpose\nAll students are asked to provide details of an emergency contact when registering for their course as part of the University’s approach to supporting the safety, welfare and wellbeing of students. This information is requested in the unlikely event that there is a serious incident, or there is serious concern for the safety, welfare and wellbeing of a student registered with the University. Whilst students are encouraged to record an emergency contact, it is not mandatory to do so. The information below sets out the possible circumstances when it may be necessary for the University to communicate with a student’s emergency contact.\nWhere an emergency contact, or other concerned third party, communicates information to the University regarding a concern for student wellbeing or welfare, the University will act in a timely manner to make contact with the student to ascertain their safety and any follow up actions. Any communication back to the emergency contact or concerned third party will be in line with this protocol.\nIn the event of a student death, this Emergency Contact Protocol will not apply. In accordance with the privacy information for students the University may provide emergency contact details to the Police who would normally be responsible for the initial, direct contact with the student’s next of kin. Only after initial Police contact would the University be in contact with the next of kin. For more information, please consult the Privacy information for students and applicants below.\nPlease note that students in the UK on a Student Route visa are also affected by the University's Policy on Immigration Sponsorship. Where academic policies and immigration policies seem to be contradictory, immigration policies will take precedence. For more information, please consult the following:\nLimitations on immigration sponsorship and Graduate Visa reporting\n2.1 Who can be an emergency contact?\nStudents can nominate a parent, relative, guardian, partner, spouse or close friend to be an emergency contact. An emergency contact is not required to be a student’s next of kin. However, a nominated emergency contact does need to be able to act on the behalf of the registered student. Students are encouraged to take the following steps.\nTo let the person nominated as emergency contact know that this has been done and that the nominated person’s contact details have been shared with the University.\nTo supply mobile telephone details rather than landline telephone details, making the contact as accessible as possible.\nTo check regularly and update emergency contact information, and change as needed via MyNottingham, to ensure accurate information is available in the case of an emergency.\nWhere an emergency contact does not speak English, the University will work with the preferred translation service as quickly as possible to ensure appropriate communication can take place.\n2.2 University use and storage of personal data\nThe University recognises students as individuals with the expectation of having information securely stored and that personal information is not shared inappropriately. These expectations will be respected in making any decision to use emergency contact details.  Each situation will be decided on a case-by-case basis, and where possible this will be in consultation and agreement with the student concerned. However, in some circumstances (for instance if a student is unconscious, or incapable of deciding) this may prevent gaining this agreement.\nUnder current data protection legislation, the University is permitted to share personal information about students without consent where there is a belief that this is necessary to protect a student’s immediate interest or those of another person. This usually means that a student will have been involved in, or that there is a risk of, an incident or an emergency where it is believed that a student or others may come to serious or lasting harm.\nThe Emergency contact information provided will be held on the University student record system, in accordance with the University's policy on 'Privacy Information for Students and Applicants' and in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For more information, please consult the following:\nPrivacy Information for Students and Applicants\n2.3 Circumstances when the University may need to get in touch with an emergency contact\nSome scenarios in which the University may get in touch with an emergency contact and share personal information with them are detailed below. Each case will always be considered on its unique circumstances. Examples include, but are not limited to:\nA student is exhibiting behaviour that may pose a serious risk to their safety and/or wellbeing or that of others.\nA student has attended or been admitted to hospital in an emergency, and where there is serious concern for a student’s immediate health or long-term health.\nA student has suffered a serious physical injury, including significant self-harm.\nA student ceases to engage with their studies, and the University has been unable to make contact to confirm their safety and wellbeing. This would usually be via the escalation process within the Student Engagement Dashboard Initiative. For more information, please consult the following:\nStudent Engagement Dashboard\nA student has not been seen in their accommodation for a period of time, and the University has been unable to make contact with them, therefore the student is considered missing.\nA student has an ongoing serious illness and they appear to be significantly deteriorating.\nIn the view of experienced mental health practitioners, there is evidence to suggest that a student is experiencing a mental health crisis, of a nature and degree that warrants contacting the emergency contact.\nA third party has reported significant concerns about a student and the University are not able to make contact to establish their safety and wellbeing.\nA student has been the victim of a serious crime.\nIn the case of any student under the age of 18 years old, the University is always required to contact the parent or guardian when there are concerns about the health, safety, wellbeing or welfare of a student. The University’s Registrar (or Registrar’s nominee) will make a decision about this where necessary and in line with the University approach to the health, safety, welfare and wellbeing of students.\nEmergency contact details will not be used for the purpose of reporting on academic progress.\n3.0 Roles and Responsibilities\nThe following staff may contact an emergency contact where required to do so: Associate Director of Student Wellbeing (or nominee(s)), and contact will usually be made by a member of the University’s professional support services.\nA decision to contact a student’s emergency contact or to share concerns about a student’s safety, welfare or wellbeing will be taken by the Director of Student and Campus Life or their nominee(s).  The University will inform the student of this decision, unless to do so would increase the risk of harm to the student or another person.\nThe Director of Student and Campus Life (or nominee) will keep a confidential record of the justification for this decision, the nature of the information shared, with whom, and the time and date of the information shared. The Director of Student and Campus Life (or Head of Security for decisions made outside of regular office hours) or their nominee will contact the emergency contact personally.\n4.0 Procedural Steps - Decision process for contacting a student’s emergency contact\nOnce a student has consented for the University to contact an emergency contact in specific circumstances (such as those set out above), this consent will be saved within the student’s case notes. The following staff may contact an emergency contact where required to do so: Associate Director of Student Wellbeing (or nominee(s)), and contact will usually be made by a member of the University’s professional support services.\nIn circumstances where the University decides to contact the emergency contact without student consent, due to a student being unable or unwilling to provide consent, but there is serious concern about their safety, welfare or wellbeing, then:\na) The responsible University staff member will set out the rationale for doing so and the nature of the serious concern about the student’s  safety, welfare or wellbeing.\nb) During regular office hours, a senior University manager, such as the Director of Student and Campus Life or Associate Director of Student Wellbeing (or their nominee) will then consider this rationale and make the decision on whether to contact the students nominated emergency contact.\nc) Outside of regular office hours this decision may be taken by the Head of Security (or nominee).\nThe University respects student’s personal information, and contact will only be made with an emergency contact with due consideration. The rationale for the necessity to contact an emergency contact will be provided by relevant professional support services staff to the Director of Student and Campus Life (or their nominee(s)) and this may be informed by advice from the Head of Data Protection.\n5.0 Related Regulations, Policies and Procedures\nPrivacy information for students and applicants\nImmigration and Sponsorship of International Students\nWhere academic policies and immigration policies seem to be contradictory, immigration policies will take precedence.\nStudent Engagement Dashboard\n6.0 Version Control Table\nVersion Control Table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nReformatted to align with new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework based on content last modified March 2023\nQSC working group\nJuly 2024\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n30 July 2024||"

The only exception is where the subject of study is a language or literature other than English.\nThe volume, timing and nature of assessment should enable students to demonstrate the extent to which they have achieved the intended learning outcomes.\nAssessment must be carried out securely, including the secure storage of assessment questions, the appropriate invigilation of examinations and the confirmation of student identity in the submission or sitting of assessments.\nSchool responsibilities\nIncludes:\nin-house exams, assessment guidelines, marking by number, recognition of other learning\nThe School is responsible for the following:\nSetting assessment at the level appropriate to the academic standard for each award of credit or qualification.\nEnsuring that student performance is equitably judged against the appropriate academic standards (see policies on marking and grading, degree classification and external examining).\nEnsuring that the principles, procedures and processes of assessment are publicised to students, academic and administrative staff, external examiners and appropriate others through suitable channels.\n* Guidance for students is also available in the Quality Manual's student engagement category; general guidance for examinations is available for sitting University examinations' and about the legibility of work submitted for assessment. For more information, please consult the Related links for students section.\nSchools wishing to hold 'in-house' examinations or tests (including on-line assessments and 'take away' examinations) should ensure that they publish written policies on the use of such assessments.  Schools holding such assessments whilst students are still being taught on other modules should ensure that there is no conflict between those assessments and student attendance at teaching or other activity associated with other modules the student is taking.\nThey should also ensure that the needs of students with dyslexia, disabilities and/or long-term medical conditions are considered when conducting such assessments. The School's policy must be included in a School's student handbook(s) or otherwise drawn to the attention of students.\nSeeing that any ‘in-house’ examinations or tests are carried out securely including a confirmation of student identity and proper invigilation of examinations. Guidance and support can be sought from the Assessment Operations team within Registry and Academic Affairs.\nEnsuring that the rules and regulations for progressing from one stage of a programme to another and for qualifying for an award are publicised to students, academic and administrative staff, external examiners and appropriate others through suitable channels. Guidance for Schools on the sort of information they should make available to students can be found in Information about Provision of Higher Education, this includes information about assessment policies and procedures.\nEnsuring that all involved in the assessment of students, including support staff who have responsibilities in this area, are competent to undertake their roles. Relevant policies include Responsibilities of the School Examinations Officer, marking and grading, Policy on occasional teachers, Policy on students who teach and any other policy mentioned in this overview.

Its content is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Assessed coursework regulations\nIncludes:\nsubmission; hard copies; deadlines\nAll assessed coursework should be submitted electronically wherever practical, except for cases where it is physically impossible due to format (e.g. physical models, hand-written fieldwork, laboratory or project notebooks/diaries, complex or hand drawn graphics or scientific notation not supported by current technologies etc).\nSchools should not otherwise request the submission of hard copies.  Cases where work is not submitted electronically will be reviewed by Faculty Associate Pro-Vice Chancellors (APVCs) annually to ensure consistent practice.\nThe standard deadline for submission of coursework on all campuses should be 15:00 local time. It is recommended that deadlines are set on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.\nExamination regulations\nIncludes:\nexpectations; late arrival; Regulations 1 - 2\nStudents must attend all examinations set as part of their programme of study.\nStudents must submit coursework required by their programme of study.\nIf a student has extenuating circumstances which they believe may affect their performance in assessed coursework or examinations, they should submit an extenuating circumstances claim (EC), by the deadline set in our Extenuating Circumstances Policy.\nIf a student has extenuating circumstances which they believe caused them to miss some or all of an examination, they should submit an extenuating circumstances claim (EC), by the deadline set in our Extenuating Circumstances Policy.\nIf a student misses an examination or fails to submit coursework and has no extenuating circumstances the University's Regulations governing attendance and engagement will be applied.\nFor more information about the Regulations governing attendance and engagement, please consult the following:\nRegulations governing attendance and engagement\nRegulation 1\nStudents late for an in-person written examination who arrive before one hour of the examination has elapsed shall be permitted to sit the paper. No extra time shall be allowed, whatever the reason for their lateness.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nExtenuating circumstances\nRegulation 2\nStudents late for any written examination who arrive one hour or more into the examination shall not be permitted to sit the paper.\nMissed assessment regulations\nIncludes:\nleaving the examination; missing an assessment; weighted average; deadlines and penalties; student responsibilities; Regulations 3 - 8\nRegulation 3\nNo student shall be permitted to leave the examination within the first hour.\nRegulation 4\n(a)\nA student who misses an assessment (this includes not submitting assessed coursework prior to the meeting of the relevant Board of Examiners) may submit an extenuating circumstances claim. If the student is offered a further assessment, the timing and form of this will be at the discretion of the student's School/Department and will be regarded as the equivalent sit at the assessment.\nFor more information about extenuating circumstance procedures, please consult the following:\nExtenuating Circumstances procedure\n(b)\nIf a student misses an assessment and is offered and declines another opportunity to take the assessment, the original mark will not be used. The student would be awarded a mark of zero for the assessment.\n(c)\nIf a student is offered another opportunity to take an element of assessment through the extenuating circumstances process, and declines the offer, then the original mark will not be used. The student would be awarded a mark of zero for the assessment.\n(d)\nIf a student takes up the opportunity for further assessment described in (a) and subsequently achieves a lower mark, that lower mark will stand.\nFor more information about the University's academic regulations, please consult the following category:\nAcademic regulations\nRegulation 5\n(a)\nStudents will be regarded as missing an assessment with sufficient cause if they have an upheld extenuating circumstances claim for circumstances in which the relevant Board of Examiners judges that it would be unreasonable to expect the student to have attempted the assessment.  Boards will reach that judgement on the basis of evidence and recommendations provided by the School/Department.\n(b)\nWhere possible, students must make their School/Department aware of circumstances that may constitute sufficient cause prior to the meeting of the relevant Board of Examiners/Extenuating Circumstances Panel.\nFor more information about extenuating circumstance procedures, please consult the following:\nExtenuating Circumstances procedure\nRegulation 6\nWhere the student has, with sufficient cause and an upheld extenuating circumstances claim, missed an assessment which counts for 50% or less of the overall module mark, the marks obtained from completed assessments may be used as the overall module mark on a 'part for whole' basis.  A Board of Examiners may recommend this course of action only after considering the relevant learning outcomes.\nThis regulation does not remove the need to offer the student another opportunity to take an assessment.\nRegulation 7\nA student who misses a timetabled assessment without sufficient cause will receive a mark of 0% in that assessment.\nRegulation 8\n(a)\nA student who submits assessed coursework after the deadline (as modified by any extensions granted by the relevant School/Department) shall have the mark for that coursework reduced by 5% for each normal working day (including vacations but not weekends, public holidays or University holidays) that has passed since the deadline, until a mark of 0% is reached. For example, an original mark of 67% would be successively reduced to 62%, 57%, etc.\nFor more information on the regulations on penalties for late submission, please consult the following:\nPolicy on penalties for late submission of assessed work\n(b)\nNotwithstanding (a) above, a student's School may specify any length of time after the coursework deadline as the point at which a mark of 0% will be awarded, so long as: the period is not longer than that which would arise from the application of Regulation 8 (a) above; and the period is given in writing to the student at the beginning of the module.\n(c)\nIn all circumstances, a student will receive a mark of 0% if, without sufficient cause, the coursework has not been submitted prior to the meeting of the relevant Board of Examiners.\nE-exams\nThere is a requirement for completed e-exam papers to be uploaded within a given timeframe, which depends on the format of the e-exam (see below).\n1.\nExamSys (formerly Rogo) e-exams invigilated on campus:\nThis timeframe is equal to the duration of the exam plus any period of ‘technical time’ permitted, added by the invigilator when a student has a technical difficulty.\n2.\nExamSys (formerly Rogo) e-exams sat remotely:\nAn additional 10 minutes is now built in to allow for IT issues, so final submission time is the length of the paper plus a further 10 minutes if needed.\n3.\nMoodle e-exams of up to 3 hours (STEs):\nIn addition to the exam length, an additional 30 minutes will be permitted for all students to cover IT issues and upload time.\nInformation provided to students will clearly state that the time permitted includes additional time for upload, and that work submitted after the end of the additional 30-minute period will not be accepted and will be given a mark of zero unless there are approved extenuating circumstances that are supported by evidence.\n4.\nMoodle e-exams of 24 hours:\nNo additional time is given for 24 hours as that already allows time for technical issues.\nWork submitted after the end of the 24-hour window will not be accepted and will be given a mark of zero unless there are approved extenuating circumstances that are supported by evidence.\n5.\nExtenuating circumstances for late submission of e-exam:\n5.1\nThe criteria to be used when considering such extenuating circumstances are:\nThe strength of the evidence of any disruption and its duration.\nThe length of the exam and how much potential advantage has been gained through late submission.\nThe clarity of communications sent to students about time allocated for uploading and the consequences of late submission.\nThe requirements (if any) of any relevant Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Bodies (PSRBs).\n5.2\nIt is noted that not all e-exams are taken in a format where late submission is possible and that some examinations are proctored. These exams are outside of the remit of this policy. Students should follow local guidance on how to proceed in these cases.\n5.3\nPossible outcomes\nWhere a paper is uploaded no more than 5 minutes after the upload time:\nPaying particular attention to the potential advantage that might have been gained through late submission and the consequences of decisions made by the EC panel for the student, the EC panel may approve the paper for marking.\nWhere a paper is uploaded after the specified upload time and the additional 5 minute window:\nEC panels may offer a first sit reassessment; this reassessment will take place at the first opportunity.\n6.\nE-exams are subject to self-certification, which allows a student to self-certify absence from exams for a maximum of 48 hours (two consecutive days). A student is not able to self-certify after the assessment window has opened.\nFor more information about self-certification (which is covered by the extenuating circumstances regulations), please consult the following:\nExtenuating circumstances regulations\n7.\nIn the case of severe system performance issues:\nAcademic and professional services leads will be provided with a summary report where there are documented system performance issues during any exam release, and QSC will advise Schools and Departments on approaches to extenuating circumstances.  In exceptional cases (e.g. significant documented system degradation), Schools may seek permission from Quality and Standards Committee to offer a blanket extenuating circumstance to an entire cohort, offering a reassessment at the earliest opportunity. Such requests should be treated, via Registry and Academic Affairs, under the QSC procedure for cases outside of regulations.\nFor more information about the QSC procedure for cases outside of regulations, please consult the following:\nQuality and Standards Committee\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n22 October 2024||"

        "header": "Policy on proofreading",
        "intro": "This page contains the University's policy on proofreading. Its content is applicable to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.",
        "content": "Policy on proofreading - The University of NottinghamPolicy on proofreading\nThis page contains the University's policy on proofreading. Its content is applicable to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Introduction\nIncludes:\nexpectations\nProofreading should initially be undertaken by students themselves; it can be a valuable learning experience for students to identify their own errors and inconsistencies. However, the University recognises that, in the course of producing a high-quality piece of work for assessment, students may wish to ask a third party to proofread work prior to submission.\nScope of the Policy\nIncludes:\noverview; roles and responsibilities of staff; exceptions; collaborative assessment\nProofreading might be undertaken by peers, housemates, family members, academic members of staff and professional proofreading companies.\nThis policy, intended for the guidance of students and staff, relates to the proofreading of any text to be submitted as part of academic coursework and projects, including dissertations and PhD theses.\nThis policy sets out what the University considers to be appropriate with regard to proofreading and what checks should be in place when proofreading is undertaken.\nExceptions\nWhilst mindful of the parameters of the policy set out below, appropriate members of staff may use their professional judgement to provide advice and guidance during the course of formative assessment, based on the individual needs of a student to maximise their opportunity to learn and understand what is expected of them academically. Those staff members are:\n1. Dissertation or project supervisors (UG and PGT) and PGR thesis supervisors\n2. Staff from Disability Support Services and Academic Support Tutors\n3. English for Academic Purposes Tutors\nIn some disciplines and for particular pieces of assessment it may not be appropriate for any proofreading to take place e.g. where correct grammar is part of the assessment criteria or assessed work submitted relating to language and translation. For example, proofreading is not acceptable for pre-sessional courses (CELE) because language proficiency is one of the key learning outcomes.\nWhere it is inappropriate for students to have their work reviewed, Schools and Departments should make students aware of this in guidance and in advance of students undertaking the assessment, for example, if project partners are not to be permitted to proofread each other’s individual reports.\nThe University acknowledges that some assessments require students to work closely to produce a collaborative piece of work for assessment. The content for these assignments will necessitate a process of drafting and re-drafting of content by a number of different members of the team. This process is a key part of the learning experience. In these cases, students may actively edit content of other students within the group although it is expected that, collectively, the group is bound by the expectations set out in this Policy in respect to engaging with further third parties. This exception only applies to those pieces of work that are explicitly assessed as part of a group exercise. No form of collusion should take place regarding standard individual pieces of work and when detected, such cases may be subject to referral under the processes outlined in the Academic misconduct procedure.\nFor more information about the Academic misconduct procedure, please consult the following:\nStudent Services - Academic misconduct procedure\nStudent responsibilities\nResponsibility for proofreading student work prior to its submission for assessment rests with the individual student as author. The University therefore wishes to provide clarity as to what proofreading of student work can reasonably entail.\nExpectation of pieces of work submitted for assessment\nIncludes:\nacademic misconduct procedure; academic misconduct policy; student declaration on submission\nThe University expects that any piece of work submitted for assessment, whether credit-bearing or not, is the student’s own work. The Academic misconduct policy provides a non-exhaustive list of examples of academic misconduct, which include:\n2.1.1 Plagiarism\n: representing another person’s work or ideas as one’s own. For example by failing to correctly acknowledge others’ ideas and work as sources of information in an assignment, and neglecting use of quotation marks. This also applies to the use of graphical material, calculations etc. in that plagiarism is not limited to text-based sources.\nWhere permitted, a proof-reader may identify spelling and basic grammar errors. Inaccuracies in academic content must not be corrected nor should the structure of the piece of work be changed; doing so may result in a charge of plagiarism. A proof-reader may be used to ensure that the work meets a quality threshold with respect to English standards, unless a School/Department policy specifically prohibits this. Students should make every effort to familiarise themselves with their School/Department’s policy regarding proof-reading. Schools/Departments should ensure this information is accessible to students.\n2.1.2 False Authorship\n: where a student is not the author of the work they have submitted. This may include a student submitting the work of another student. This may also include the submission of work that has been produced (in whole or in part) by another student or third party. As it is the authorship of an assignment that is contested, there is no requirement to prove that the assignment has been purchased.\n2.1.3 Collusion\n: cooperation in order to gain an unpermitted advantage. This may occur where students have consciously collaborated on a piece of work, in part or whole, and passed it off as their own individual efforts or where one student has authorised another to use their work, in part or whole, and to submit it as their own.\nStudents who submit pieces of work for assessment where proofreaders have acted in a way that compromises the authenticity of that work and who have acted outside of the limitations set out in this policy will be investigated under the Academic misconduct procedure. It is the student’s responsibility to inform their proofreader of the University’s proofreading policy and to check their own piece of work prior to submission to ensure that it is in line with University policy and expectations.\nStudents will be required to make a declaration on submission that they have acted in line with University policy and expectations for proofreading.\nFor more information about the Academic misconduct policy and procedure, please consult the following:\nAcademic misconduct policy\nStudent Services - Academic misconduct procedure\nAcceptable practices by proofreaders\nIncludes:\npolicy restrictions\nThird-party proofreaders are not expected to actively amend existing, or create new, content in draft work; instead they should support the student by identifying errors and/or making suggestions relating to, but not creating, content.\nAny third party reviewing work should be familiar with this policy and agree to operate within its expectations. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that the proofreader is aware of the Policy and no proofreading should be undertaken if the individual concerned does not agree to align their practice with the conditions detailed below. At the point of submission, students will be expected to declare whether or not they have had their work proofread and if so, indicate that the proofreader has worked within the Policy’s restrictions (set out below).\nThe University considers it acceptable for proofreaders to:\nIdentify spelling and typographical errors\nIdentify poor grammar e.g. tense use, verb form, sentence structure, word order\nHighlight formatting errors or inconsistencies\nIdentify spelling/grammar/typographical errors in labelling of diagrams, charts or figures\nIdentify typographical errors in equations\nHighlight a sentence or paragraph that is overly complex or where the intended meaning is not clear\nDraw attention to repeated phrases or omitted words\nIdentify errors in the referencing system applied\nThe University does not consider it acceptable practice for proofreaders to amend existing content whether through addition or reduction and, in particular, they must not:\nRewrite passages of text to clarify the meaning\nChange any words or figures, except to correct spelling\nCheck or rewrite calculations, formulae, equations or computer code\nRearrange or reformat passages of text\nContribute any additional material to the original\nRedraw, alter or relabel diagrams, charts or figures\nAlter argument or logic, where faulty\nImplement or alter a referencing system or add to references\nCheck or correct facts, data calculations, formulae or equations\nCorrecting errors identified in the reference system applied\nTranslate text drafted by students, noting that this does not prohibit translation of source material as long as it is properly referenced\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n03 June 2024||"

Its content is applicable to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Relationship to other Policies\nThis policy should be read in conjunction with the Policy on circumstances affecting students’ ability to study and complete assessments.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nPolicy on circumstances affecting students’ ability to study and complete assessments\n1. Principles\nIncludes\n: examples of long-term conditions or disabilities\nThe University of Nottingham has a long-established support provision for students who describe themselves as disabled, as covered by the Equality Act 2010. The University of Nottingham is strongly committed to equality of opportunity for all students and the provision offered to disabled students begins at the application stage.\nAll students who declare a disability at application stage are contacted by Disability Support Services before arrival at the University to ensure that, as far as possible, appropriate support is available to meet the needs of the individual.\nDisability Support Services consists of Specialist Study Support Tutors who work with students with Specific Learning Differences, such as dyslexia, dyspraxia, and ADHD, whilst the Disability Advisers work with students with a recognised disability and/or long-term health condition, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and mental health difficulties and the ACCESS Centre.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nDisability Support Services\n2. Responsibilities of Disability Support Services\nIncludes:\nrole of Disability Liaison Officer\nDisability Support Services will contact applicants who have indicated that they have a disability, Specific Learning Difference, ASD, mental health difficulty, long-term health condition or other long-term circumstances in their application prior to coming to the University.\nWhere appropriate, Disability Support Services are responsible for identifying reasonable adjustments (referred to as ‘accommodations’) in the form of, for example, alternative examination arrangements and in-class arrangements. Disability Support Services will share details of accommodations with relevant members of staff, including the Student Support and Wellbeing Officer and Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) in the student’s academic school and the central examinations office.\nDisability Support Services will facilitate the Disability Liaison Officers network. Each academic school has a Student Support and Wellbeing Officer and a DLO. The Disability Support Services Team will liaise with the Student Support and Wellbeing Officer, DLO and other members of the academic school to discuss the individual support needs of a student if this is required.\nFor more information about the DLO, please consult the following:\nStudents with disabilities\nDisability Support Services will provide staff and students with general advice in relation to Specific Learning Differences and other disabilities, long-term health conditions or mental health difficulties at any point during the academic year.\nDisability Support Services will provide advice on accommodations for examinations and in-class arrangements, such as an extension to a coursework deadline.\nDisability Support Services will provide a range of support services to students, including; one to one and drop-in sessions, small group work, workshops and direction to screening tools.\nDisability Support Services provide staff training sessions to all staff in order to increase understanding of disability, raise awareness of reasonable adjustments and inclusive practice.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nDisability Support Services\n3. Responsibilities of Students\nIn addition to core responsibilities set out in the Policy on circumstances affecting students’ ability to study and complete assessments:\ni.\nStudents who are aware of a disability, long-term health condition or other long-term circumstances (as outlined in the Principles section of this policy) that is expected to have an impact on their performance should make their School aware of those circumstances at the earliest possible opportunity.\nii.\nStudents should ensure that they access relevant support services that are available to them to ensure that all possible assistance is provided.\nFor more information about the Policy, please consult the following:\nPolicy on circumstances affecting students’ ability to study and complete assessments\n4. Accommodations for disabilities and long-term medical conditions\nThe following processes are in place to support students requiring accommodations:\nReferral to Disability Support Services to ensure core reasonable adjustments are identified and implemented.\nFor circumstances affecting assessments there is a procedure to implement Examination Arrangements for students who have a disability or long-term medical condition.\nSuch arrangements are intended to make full adjustment for the condition/disability so  no further adjustment or consideration would be appropriate.  It may be appropriate for  students to consider voluntarily interrupting their studies whilst arrangements are made  and appropriate support is put in place.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nDisability Support Services\nExamination Arrangements for students who have a disability or long-term medical condition\n5. Requests for extensions to coursework/assignment deadlines on the grounds of a disability or long-term medical condition\ni.\nStudents who have a Support Plan have access to possible coursework extensions, which indicates that Schools and Departments should consider requests for extensions, wherever possible, on the grounds of their circumstances and they are not expected to submit an Extenuating Circumstances claim. A Coursework Extension Request form is available on the Student Services webpages and students making the request on the basis of a Support Plan should seek approval from the designated member of School staff BEFORE the original submission date. It is the School’s responsibility to inform students who the designated member of School staff is in their School.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nStudent Services - students with support plans\nii.\nWhere a student has submitted a Coursework Extension Request form but has not had a response to indicate whether an extension is being granted by the time of the deadline, the student should submit whatever work they have completed at the time of the deadline such that, if necessary, it can form the assessment. Having submitted the work done to date, students should continue working in order that, should an extension be granted (which would be from the original submission date), they are able to take full advantage of any extra time allowed.\niii.\nStudents seeking an extension who do not have a Support Plan indicating that Schools and Departments should consider requests for extensions should submit a claim using the Extenuating Circumstances procedure. For more information, please consult the following:\nExtenuating Circumstances procedure\n6. Late Diagnosis of Long Term Health Conditions/Disabilities\nWhere Disability Support Services has assessed a student as requiring adjustment to normal arrangements for assessment but it is too close to a scheduled examination for the adjustment to be put in place for a centrally arranged examination the School should follow the procedure on the Student Services – Service Development website and if possible arrange for the assessment to take place in the School. If this is not possible the student may request deferral of the relevant examination(s) such that the adjustment can be made to a centrally arranged examination. Where diagnosis of a long term health condition/disability is made after an assessment has taken place it may be appropriate to annul assessments from the current session and allow the student to take them again such that they can gain a properly representative mark or to take the circumstances into account at the Board of Examiners at the award classification stage under the relevant Study Regulations. Further backdating of any adjustment will not occur.\nWhere diagnosis of a long term health condition/disability that requires support for study to be put in place is made during the academic year it may be appropriate to allow the student to repeat the relevant year/semester (for which a fee would be payable). Further backdating will not occur. Alternatively one of the outcomes may be applied:\n(a)\nFor any student provide support for the student to compensate for the circumstances. If this is provided and is intended to make due adjustment for the circumstances, the same circumstances cannot be considered under any other University procedure.\nor\n(b)\nFor Undergraduate Students and Postgraduate Students on taught programmes\nBring the circumstances forward for consideration at the Board of Examiners which may consider annulling the affected year/semester and offering the student a repeat period of study (for which tuition fees will be payable) subject to this being an option supported by any sponsor or legal obligation and to the University’s policy on Maximum Period from Initial Registration.\nor\n(c)\nFor Postgraduate Research students\nOne or more of the following actions should be applied:\n(i)\nUndertake a further annual review if the student fails their annual review.\n(ii)\nSupport the student in applying for an additional period of registered study and to the University’s policy on Maximum Period from Initial Registration.\n(iii)\nSupport the student in applying for an extension to their thesis pending period and to the University’s policy on Maximum Period from Initial Registration.\nFor more information about the maxima, please consult the following:\nMaximum period from initial registration for completion of studies\nWhere a student has not had appropriate adjustment in the current session for a late diagnosis they should submit a claim under the Extenuating Circumstances procedure as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed.\nWhere the condition is not covered by the Equality Act 2010, extenuating circumstances claims will be considered if submitted within the timescales provided for at section 9 of the Extenuating Circumstances procedure. For more information, please consult the following:\nExtenuating Circumstances procedure\nWhere the student’s condition is covered by the Equality Act 2010, a School must consider claims submitted before a Board of Examiners (or equivalent for PGR students) has reached a decision on the student’s results. The University will also consider the circumstances if an Academic Appeal is submitted within one month of the notification of a progression or award decision. The Academic Appeal submitted by the student will need to demonstrate that new evidence was not, and could not have been, made available to the Board of Examiners at the time of its original decision. Any such matters which could have been raised before the meeting of the Board, but, without good reason, were not raised, will not be considered in the event of an Appeal.\nIn making a decision on the action to be taken, Schools/Appeal handlers should consider what adjustment would have been made had the disability, long-term health condition or other long-term circumstances been known earlier in the session.  If any appropriate adjustments have already been applied, no further action is necessary, otherwise actions should be backdated to cover the most recent session only.\nAdvice on the Equality Act is available from the University’s Disability Support Services website. For more information, please consult the following:\nDisability Support Services\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n08 April 2022||"

This information is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Please note that students in the UK on a Student Route visa are also affected by the University's Policy on Immigration Sponsorship. Where academic policies and immigration policies seem to be contradictory, immigration policies will take precedence. For more information, please consult the following:\nImmigration sponsorship\n1.0 Purpose\nThis page lists the maximum periods for the completion of studies from their initial points of registration and related information including exceptional circumstances, UoNO and external requirements.\n2.0 Key Principles\nStudents may need to extend their normal period of engagement with an individual programme for a variety of reasons. The University is flexible in making such arrangements, but there is an expectation that students will complete their studies within an absolute maximum time period from their initial registration, regardless of individual circumstances, to ensure the currency of their knowledge, their competency and the quality of their degree. To that effect, please be aware of the following:\nWhere students have changed programme, the set period relates to the initial registration on their original programme except where the student is transferring to the beginning of the first stage of a programme – in which case, the set period relates to the initial registration on the new programme.\nThis does not apply to University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC) programmes where the Ministry of Education requires that all periods are counted from initial registration, regardless of transfers.\nThe normal period of registered study for each qualification of the University is set out in the University of Nottingham Qualifications Framework (UNQF). For more information about the UNQF, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\nIn addition a student is not allowed to take more than three years to complete teaching and assessment that would normally be completed within one year, whether full or part-time.\nIn certain specific circumstances a period of voluntary interruption will automatically extend the maximum period of registration for the programme by up to one year. At UNUK and UNM voluntary interruption of up to one year due to disability, long term health issues, caring and parental responsibilities, maternity/paternity/adoptive leave, compulsory services (e.g. military), financial difficulties, or as a function of issues relating to students who are part of the exceptional performance athlete or scholars at risk programmes will extend the maximum by one year.\nThis does not apply to University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC) programmes.\nAt UNNC voluntary interruption of up to one year due to military service will extend the maximum by one year.\nOther circumstances, not detailed above, such as other periods of voluntary interruption, repeat study or enforced suspension for reason of debt, the absolute maxima shown in the table below apply. In such cases, the School may apply to QSC for an extension to the maximum where it believes this is appropriate.\n2.1 Extensions due to exceptional circumstances\nAn exception to the application of these maxima is where a student has a disability, or carer responsibility, that is causing, or has caused, the delay in completing their studies. Whilst the University would normally expect the maximum periods from initial registration to provide adequate opportunity for adjustment and support for students with disabilities, or carer responsibilities, there may be exceptional circumstances, beyond one year, in which further adjustment to maximum periods could be considered. In this case, the student must provide the school with an explanation and evidence of their circumstances.\nThe school will then need to judge whether, in the light of these circumstances, it is possible for the student to complete their studies within a period that sufficiently ensures the currency of their knowledge, their competency and the quality of their degree. If the school believes that it is, on balance, appropriate to extend the absolute maximum for that student, they will then provide a new absolute maximum to which the student must adhere.\nExtensions to the maximum period of registration authorised by the School must be reported to the Quality and Student Management Systems Team in Registry and Academic Affairs (RAA).\n2.2 Table of absolute maxima for the completion of all full and part-time programmes.\nTable of absolute maxima for the completion of all full and part-time programmes\nAbsolute maximum period for completion – Full-time\nAbsolute maximum period for completion – Part-time\nFoundation Certificate\n3 years\n3 years\nUndergraduate Certificate\n3 years\n3 years\nUndergraduate Diploma\n6 years\n12 years\nOrdinary Degree (from start of Honours programme)*For students entering Qualifying year or Part I from September 2015, this degree is only available as an exit award\n6 years\n12 years\nGraduate Certificate\n3 years\n3 years\nGraduate Diploma\n3 years\n3 years\nHonours Degree\n6 years\n12 years\nBachelors Honours Degree with Foundation Stage*Known as Preliminary Year at University of Nottingham Ningbo Campus (UNNC)\n8 years\n12 years\nIntegrated Master's Degree\n8 years\n12 years\nIntegrated Master's Degree with Foundation Stage\n10 years\n12 years\nMedical Degree BM, BS (five-year programme)\n10 years\n12 years\nMedical Degree BM, BS (four-year graduate entry programme)\n8 years\n12 years\nVeterinary Medicine MVM, MVS\n6 years\n12 years\nVeterinary Medicine BVM, BVS\n10 years\n12 years\nVeterinary Medicine with Preliminary year BVM, BVS\n12 years\n12 years\nDip Arch with Bachelor's as first element and including year out\n12 years\n12 years\nDip Arch with Integrated Master's as first element and including year out\n12 years\n12 years\nPostgraduate Certificate\n3 years\n3 years\nPostgraduate Diploma\n3 years\n3 years\nPostgraduate Certificate in Higher Education\n3 years\n4 years\nTaught Master's\n3 years\n6 years\nTwo Year Taught Master's\n4 years\n8 years\nTaught masters with Pre-Master's year (UNNC)\n4 years\n8 years\nMRes/MSc/MA by Research\n3 years\n6 years\nMPhil\n4 years\n8 years\nProfessional Doctorate\n6 years\n12 years\nPhD\n6 years\n12 years\nAbsolute maximum period for completion\nAbsolute maximum period for completion – with EC\nUoNO microcredential\n12 months\n15 months\nUoNO microcredential Postgraduate Certificate programme\n3 years\n3 years\nUoNO microcredential Postgraduate Diploma programme\n3 years\n3 years\n2.3 UoNO Microcredentials\nStudents wishing to count UoNO Microcredentials towards the award of a UoN qualification are also bound by the maximum periods described. The ‘maximum period of registration’ commences on the date at which the student registers for their first Microcredential that they wish to put towards the award of a UoN qualification.\nSchools being asked to make an award may submit a case to QSC to count UoNO Microcredentials commenced before that date under the ROL regulations, so long as they are satisfied that to do so would not undermine the currency of the qualification and would not violate any PSRB requirements.\nA learner enrolled on a microcredential may stay enrolled on that microcredential for a maximum of 12 months from the date of registration unless there are extenuating circumstances.\nExtenuating Circumstances\n2.4 External requirements\nIf the regulations of an external accrediting body require a shorter time frame for an individual programme, or any legal requirement restricts the ability of a student to study as required or attend the University, the external requirement overrides the University maximum period.\nProgramme specifications state where an external restriction applies to the period of study. Where a student is on an accredited degree or a programme leading to professional registration and their normal period of study has been extended, it may be necessary for them to undertake additional assessment to prove competency prior to conferral of their award.\n2.5 Visa-related\nThe maxima which are outlined within the table do not imply that where relevant a student will necessarily be able to obtain a visa for the extended period.\nStudents on a visa must seek advice from the Visa and Immigration team on their campus if their normal period of registration is potentially to be extended.\n2.6 Refusal and withdrawal\nA school must refuse to allow a student to interrupt study, repeat study, take external assessments or any other action that would result in it being impossible for that student to complete their studies within the defined time frames or those imposed by external requirements or limitations.\nA student who for any reason will not be able to complete their studies within the maximum time frame will be withdrawn from the University as soon as this is evident. In such cases, a student will be awarded a lower level qualification if such a qualification exists and they have satisfied the regulations for that award.\nFor more information concerning regulations for students who have not met their honours requirements, please consult the following category:\nAcademic regulations\n3.0 Related Regulations, Policies and Procedures\nExtenuating Circumstances\nAcademic Regulations\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\n4.0 Version Control Table\nVersion Control Table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nReformatted to align with the new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework based on content last modified on 23rd January 2024\nQSC\nJuly 2024\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n30 July 2024||"

        "content": "About the Quality Manual - The University of NottinghamAbout the Quality Manual\nThis page provides important information about the University of Nottingham's Quality Manual, as well as its associated governance and responsibilities for compliance across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.1.0 Introduction/Overview\nThe Quality Manual sets out the framework that governs all teaching and learning at the University of Nottingham.  It forms a central point of reference for all campuses (i.e. UNNC, UNM and UNUK); for staff, students. learners and apprentices.\nIt draws together a series of interlinked activities that support quality assurance for programmes, modules, short courses, micro-credentials, and the award of credit from the University of Nottingham. In this way we can enable compliance with all our regulators through a high quality student experience and successful student outcomes.\n2.0 Purpose\nThe purpose of the Quality Manual is to:\nEnable the effective and efficient monitoring of academic standards and the quality of the student experience in relation to internal priorities and external requirements (such as those stated in the QAA’s Quality Code and from accrediting professional, statutory and regulatory bodies);\nEnsure consistency, whilst enabling and acknowledging appropriately diverse discipline practices;\nProvide a mechanism for critical review and, in doing so, highlight and promote good practice across the institution.\n3.0 Scope\nThis information is relevant to staff and students, learners and apprentices across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.\nNote, in most circumstances references to ‘students’ in the quality manual also means apprentices and learners.\nWhere there are separate procedures or requirements for particular campuses or groups of students/learners, this is stated within the Quality Manual.\n4.0 Key Principles\n4.1 Governance\nThe University of Nottingham has Degree Awarding Powers (DAP) authorised by the Office for Students (OfS) in England. Where students have studied in Malaysia, the degree programme is accredited by the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA) and recognised by the Malaysian Government. In China programmes run with the approval of the Chinese Ministry of Education.\nAll of our degree awards are of equal merit and standing across the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.\nAll of The University of Nottingham’s awards align with the sector standards and where applicable Professional, Statutory,  Regulatory Body (PSRB) and Ofsted requirements. Quality regulations and processes are mapped against Office for Students’ conditions of registration for quality and standards to ensure compliance.  We also adhere to the QAA Quality Code.\nQAA Quality Code\nExpectations for standards:\nThe academic standards of courses meet the requirements of the relevant national qualifications framework.\nThe value of qualifications awarded to students at the point of qualifications and over time is in line with sector-recognised standards.\nExpectations for quality:\nCourses are well-designed, provide a high-quality academic experience for all students and enable a student's achievement to be reliably assessed.\nFrom admission through to completion, all students are provided with the support that they need to succeed in and benefit from higher education.\nThe Framework supports the University of Nottingham’s values of inclusivity, ambition, openness, fairness and respect.\n4.2 Responsibility for the Quality Manual\nResponsibility for the Quality Manual lies within the Quality and Standards Committee, which reports to the Teaching and Learning Committee, and thus the Education and Student Experience Committee. For more information, please visit the following links:\nQuality and Standards Committee\nTeaching and Learning Committee\nEducation and Student Experience Committee\nMany of the processes underpinning the Quality Manual are managed by Registry and Academic Affairs(RAA).  The key exception being the responsibility for the Annual Monitoring process and EEAR processes [add full term] which are managed by the Education Excellence Team.  Some decisions of the Quality and Standards Committee are delegated to other committees or departments.\nRAA and School/Faculty colleagues are all able to monitor its ongoing effectiveness and to suggest improvements and corrections, plus relevant Associate Directors and QSC members review the content annually.\nThis electronic copy of the Quality Manual should be seen as the most up to date version and supersedes any and all previously published versions either online or in print. Any changes to these regulations or processes must be submitted to QSC for consideration.\n4.3 Compliance\nAcross all of our campuses, responsibility for quality assurance and for the implementation of the Quality Manual rests with the Head of School or Department, under the jurisdiction of Senate and its committees. Within each School/Department or Faculty and within RAA, there will be processes in place to keep practices under review and in line with the Quality Manual.  Any Schools with provision on more than one campus will therefore be regarded as multi-campus entities for the purposes of the Quality Manual. Please refer to the International Campuses page for more details\nInternational Campuses and Quality Assurance\nThe Registrar’s Department (i.e. Registry and Academic Affairs (UNUK); Academic Services Office (UNNC); Student Registry Office (UNM)) is responsible for interpreting the Quality Manual and thus, for determining whether an action is in accordance with its provisions and whether an approval at University-level is required.\nIf a School is informed that an action is outside the provisions of the Quality Manual but still wishes to pursue that particular course, the relevant School or Deptartment should prepare the case paperwork for QSC and forward it to the relevent Registrar’s Department who will arrange for that request to be considered on behalf of Quality and Standards Committee (QSC).\n4.4 Responsibilities and delegation\nIt is the Head of School’s responsibility to keep their School’s practice under review and in line with the Quality Manual, as reviewed through the Periodic Review process.\nWhere responsibility is delegated, this should be formally documented and appropriate protocols made clear; where autonomy has been granted to another unit by the Head of School, the School is still responsible for ensuring that the policies and procedures within the Quality Manual are implemented.\nFor more information on delegated responsibilities in relation to international campuses please see the following link:\nInternational Campuses and Quality Assurance\n4.5 Application across campuses\nThe Quality Manual applies equally across all campuses. Localised variations can exist where thay have been clearly noted. Where possible, national flags (representing the UK, China and Malaysia campuses) have been added to draw attention to any links and sections which are of relevance to a particular campus. These will appear as follows:\nfor the University of Nottingham UK (UNUK) campus\nfor the University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC) campus\nfor the University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) campus\nWhere there is no indication for a specific campus variation, this means that the content is equally applicable across all of UNUK, UNNC and UNM.\n4.6 Navigation\nThe Quality Manual has been split into 12 categories, which can be accessed here [add link], with additional sections to cover Policies, Recent Changes and Coming Soon. These can be accessed through the tiles, or through the links in the navigation list on the left hand side of every page.\nIndividual elements of the Quality Manual can often not be considered in isolation. Relevant additional pages are provided as links within that page, where possible, plus it is often useful to look back at the ‘parent’ page and the ‘sibling’ or ‘child’ pages.\nWhere it is stated that Schools or students ‘should’ take particular actions or follow certain principles, this is a requirement with regulatory force across all of our campuses and must be complied with. I.e. please read ‘may’ or ‘should’ as ‘must’.  Please note, we are currently undertaking work in the Quality Manual to replace ‘should’ with ‘must’, but in the meanwhile please consider ‘should’ to mean ‘must’.\n5.0 Related Policies\nFrom July 2020, all Policies included within the Quality Manual have also been listed within a dedicated Policies section, which functions as a directory. This can be accessed by using the “Policies A - Z” button in the lower left corner of every page (within the Quality Manual)\n6.0 Related Procedures\nPlease note that anyone can request a change to the Quality Manual by submitting a request to Quality and Standards Committee (QSC). For more information about this process, please consult the following:\nQuality and Standards Committee\n7.0 Version control and updates\nTo ensure that its content is constantly available and up-to-date, the Quality Manual is only available on the web. Users are free to print off their own copies but should remember that these may become quickly outdated.\nThe Quality Manual is reviewed each year to ensure that staff and students can be confident that all information contained in it is current.  To supplement this activity a rolling programme of comprehensive reviews for each section once every three years will be introduced from the 23/24 session.  New developments in external requirements, e.g., Office for Students, Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education, Malaysian Qualifications Agency, Ministry of Education in China, etc, may also result in a review of relevant sections within the Quality Manual.\n7.1 Recent Changes and Coming Soon\nThe Quality Manual is not a static printed document; it is subject to change as policies are revised or guidance is updated. When changes are made to the Quality Manual, these are routinely logged in an area which can be accessed at any time by using the “Recent changes” button in the lower right corner of every page (within the Quality Manual).\nSimilarly, changes that have been approved but which are not live yet or which are being considered can be found in the ‘Coming Soon’ section of the Quality Manual.\nComing Soon\nRecent and coming soon Quality Manual changes pages should be standing items on all Education and Student Experience committees.\nRegular summaries of changes are also emailed directly to key contacts. It is School’s responsibility to notify QSC of changes to key contacts (e.g. if a new Director of Education and Student Experience is appointed). Also, if you wish to be added to this circulation list, please email\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\n.\n7.2 Version Control Table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nReformatted to align with new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework; Content also reviewed and updated to improve clarity.\nQSC\nJuly 2024\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n31 July 2024||"

The information will include:\nadmissions data\ndrop-out rates (terminations and withdrawals)\nsubmission rates\nsuccessful completion rates.\n2.\nFor comparative purposes, Schools will also be provided with aggregate data for their Faculty and for the institution as a whole. The same data set will be available to Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) and QSC will approach any Schools where the data suggested difficulties might exist in order to discuss the remedial action to be taken. QSC will also consider the institutional totals with a view to identifying any need for changes to policy or procedures.\n3.\nIt will be left up to individual Schools to decide on a School procedure for the monitoring of research degree programmes. Typically, a School Postgraduate Students Committee or equivalent will consider the data in 1 above, along with any other relevant information (eg from a Student Staff Forum), and determine whether anything gives cause for concern. Where a problem is detected, this should then be brought to the attention of the School management through the School’s communication and decision-making channels.\n4.\nThe University Educational Enhancement and Assurance Review process will be used to check that annual monitoring of research degree programmes is taking place in Schools and that effective use is being made of the results of the monitoring.\n*PGR monitoring is currently on hold and will resume in 2022/23\nResources\nIncludes:\ntemplate for research degree programmes; link to the annual monitoring workspace\nAll Schools should use the following:\nResearch Monitoring Form\nFor more detailed information, please consult the following:\nMonitoring - Workspace\nMonitoring\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n21 September 2023||"

For the purposes of this document such teachers are referred to as \"Postgraduate Student Teachers\".\n* Here \"teaching\" includes formal lectures, seminars, tutorials, demonstrating in laboratory classes etc.\n1.2.\nThe quality of the teaching provided by a Postgraduate Student Teacher must be broadly equivalent to that which might be expected of a new full-time member of academic staff - bearing in mind that Postgraduate Student Teachers will not have had the same level or amount of training as new full-time academic staff, and that their teaching duties are limited in scope.\n1.3.\nA Postgraduate Student Teacher must have appropriate skills, experience and knowledge in the subject area being taught.\n1.4.\nA Postgraduate Student Teacher must have received appropriate training before undertaking their duties.\n1.5.\nThe quality of the work of the Postgraduate Student Teacher must be monitored so that any problems can be resolved without detriment to the students being taught.\n1.6.\nThe nature and extent of the Postgraduate Student Teacher's duties are limited, as set out below.\n1.7.\nA Postgraduate Student Teacher will be paid an appropriate rate for the teaching activity.\n1.8.\nA Postgraduate Student Teacher may normally only be involved in the teaching of modules aimed primarily at undergraduate students. It is permissible for a Postgraduate Student Teacher to be involved in the teaching of postgraduate students if they have the skills, experience and knowledge appropriate to that level of teaching.\n1.9.\nA Postgraduate Student Teacher's teaching duties must not interfere with their own studies, and their Supervisor must give prior assent to any such work on an annual basis to ensure that their ability to complete their thesis on time is not affected.\n1.10.\nUnless specified in the terms of a studentship, postgraduate research students are not obligated to undertake any teaching.\n2.

Training, induction and support\nIncludes:\nmentor; hands-on experience; feedback\n4.1.\nOn appointment as a Postgraduate Student Teacher, an individual training needs assessment must be undertaken by a member of the School's academic staff. It is expected that unless the postgraduate student has direct relevant teaching experience, training will be required. The training needs analysis must be documented (sample form available) and written confirmation provided by the Postgraduate Student Teacher and the module convenor that the training has been completed satisfactorily prior to any teaching being undertaken.\n4.2.\nTraining may take a variety of forms (ranging from practical training on how to use equipment to more formal courses provided within the School, by the Graduate School or organisations external to the University) and will be determined by the sort of teaching being undertaken by the Postgraduate Student Teacher.\n4.3.\nAll Postgraduate Student Teachers should be assigned a mentor, such as the module convenor, who must be a member of academic staff, who can provide guidance and advice.\n4.4.\nPostgraduate Student Teachers involved in demonstrating should be given hands-on experience with the equipment concerned and should be familiarised with health and safety issues.\n4.5.\nPostgraduate Student Teachers should receive constructive and regular feedback on their performance (including strengths and weaknesses) by the module convenor or another member of full-time academic staff. The Postgraduate Student Teacher's performance should be monitored over the duration of the teaching and this should include classroom observation.\n5. Involvement in assessment\nIncludes:\nresponsibilities; moderation by academic staff\n5.1.\nAssessment lies at the heart of the maintenance of academic standards, and the involvement of a Postgraduate Student Teacher in assessment must be limited and carefully controlled.\n5.2.\nIn respect of any assessment carried out by Postgraduate Student Teachers, Heads of School must ensure that:\n5.2.1.\nThey are supervised by a named member of academic staff\n5.2.2.\nThey are provided with training appropriate to their role in the assessment process\n5.2.3.\nAssessments that contribute to the final module/course mark are:\na)\nModerated by a member of academic staff. Example methods of moderation include:\nSampling, either by an external examiner or by an internal second marker;\nAdditional marking of borderlines, firsts and fails\nAdditional marking where there is significant disparity between the different elements of assessment for an individual student, in a unit or across the programme\nAdditional marking where there is significant disparity between the marks of different markers in a particular unit or programme.\nb)\nLimited, as far as practicable, to those elements of assessment that do not contribute to the degree classification\n5.2.4.\nSuch assessments which do not contribute to the final module/course mark are second marked where appropriate on a sampling basis by a member of academic staff\n6.

This information is primarily directed at staff but may also be of interest to students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.For information relating to the role and appointment of examiners for research degree programmes, please consult the following:\nRole and appointment of examiners for research degree programmes\n1. Appointment\nIncludes:\nSchool responsibilities; responsibilities of the University; collaboration implications\n1.1\nSchools are responsible for providing nominations of external examiners for their undergraduate and taught postgraduate courses on an annual basis. Council has the power to receive nominations and approve such appointments, and discharges its responsibilities in this regard through the Quality and Standards Committee (QSC).\n1.2\nThe University’s Charter requires that all assessments for programmes and modules forming part of the programme of studies required for University Degrees, Diplomas and Certificates must involve one or more independent external examiners. The specific responsibilities of each external examiner will be clearly specified in letters of appointment.\n1.3\nWhere the award is made by the University of Nottingham and the programme is collaborative, the appointment of examiner(s) will be the responsibility of the University of Nottingham. Appointments of examiners for joint and dual awards will be determined when the partnership agreement is negotiated.  Where the external examiner is appointed to a collaborative programme, the report may be made available to the partner institution on a confidential basis.\n1.4\nThe School has a duty to ensure that a sufficient number of external examiners is appointed to ensure adequate expertise is available to cover all the major areas of the syllabus being examined, including the requirements of professional, statutory and regulatory bodies which may also include requirements that extend beyond the confines of the syllabus.\n1.5\nThe School has a duty to ensure there is an appropriate match between the numbers of external examiners nominated and the quantity of material being examined.\n1.6\nWhere programmes are offered across one or more of the University’s campuses, the remit of the examiners appointed should cover all relevant campuses so that they are in a position to provide a judgment on the comparability of quality and standards of provision and performance across the campuses.\n2. Main responsibilities of external examiners\n2.1\nThe main responsibilities of external examiners are:\nTo provide informative comment and recommendations on whether the programme(s) and/or module(s) in the remit of the external examiner meet the threshold academic standards set for its awards in accordance with the frameworks for higher education qualifications and applicable subject benchmark statements, including any requirements of professional, statutory and regulatory bodies which may also include requirements that extend beyond the confines of the syllabus;\nTo provide input to professional, statutory and regulatory bodies in cases where they specifically require external examiner input, which may also include requirements that extend beyond the confines of the syllabus;\nTo provide informative comment and recommendations upon whether the assessment process measures student achievement rigorously and fairly against the intended outcomes of the programme(s) and is conducted in line with the relevant policies and regulations;\nTo check whether the academic standards and achievements of students are comparable with those in other UK higher education institutions of which the external examiners have experience.  In addition, examiners are asked to provide a judgement on the comparability of standards of provision and performance across the Nottingham UK, Malaysia and China campuses, where they are appointed for courses which are offered at more than one of the University’s campuses.\n3. Enhancement of quality\n3.1\nIn addition to the responsibilities outlined in the previous section, external examiners are asked to provide informative comment and recommendations on any good practice and innovation relating to learning, teaching and assessment they observe, and also opportunities to enhance the quality of the learning opportunities provided to students.\n4. National criteria for appointment and termination of contract\nIncludes:\nrequirements; non-Higher Education backgrounds; the right to review appointments\n4.1\nExternal examiners can be appointed if they show appropriate evidence, which is likely to be by providing an outline career summary rather than a full curriculum vitae, of satisfying the following criteria:\nI.\nknowledge and understanding of UK sector agreed reference points for the maintenance of academic standards and assurance and enhancement of quality\nII.\ncompetence and experience in the fields covered by the programme of study, or parts thereof\nIII.\nrelevant academic and/or professional qualifications to at least the level of the qualification being externally examined, and/or extensive practitioner experience where appropriate\nIV.\ncompetence and experience relating to designing and operating a variety of assessment tasks appropriate to the subject and operating assessment procedures\nV.\nsufficient standing, credibility and breadth of experience within the discipline to be able to command the respect of peers and, where appropriate, professional peers\nVI.\nfamiliarity with the standard to be expected of students to achieve the award that is to be assessed\nVII.\nfluency in English, and where programmes are delivered and assessed in languages other than English, fluency in the relevant language(s) (unless other secure arrangements are in place to ensure that external examiners are provided with the information to make their judgements)\nVIII.\nmeeting applicable criteria set by professional, statutory or regulatory bodies\nIX.\nawareness of current developments in the design and delivery of relevant curricula\nX.\ncompetence and experience relating to the enhancement of the student experience.\n4.2\nNominees from backgrounds other than higher education, for example business, industry or the professions, may not be able to fulfil all the criteria above but would nonetheless be able to make a significant contribution as an external examiner. Consideration can be given to such nominations being approved by Quality and Standards Committee (QSC), in particular where the appointee may be part of a team or examiners, or where the School is able to confirm that appropriate training and support will be provided.\n4.3\nIn view of the importance of external examiners’ reports in the quality assurance process, the University reserves the right to review the appointment of an external examiner who fails to fulfil the terms of contract, or if a conflict of interest arises which cannot be satisfactorily resolved.\n5. Restrictions on appointment\nIncludes:\ncategories and circumstances; reappointment restrictions\n5.1\nAnyone who is included in the following categories or circumstances may not be appointed:\nI.\na member of a governing body or committee of the appointing institution or one of its collaborative partners, or a current employee of the appointing institution or one of its collaborative partners\nII.\nanyone with a close professional, contractual or personal relationship with a member of staff or student involved with the programme of study\nIII.\nanyone required to assess colleagues who are recruited as students to the programme of study\nIV.\nanyone who is, or knows they will be, in a position to influence significantly the future of students on the programme of study\nV.\nanyone who is, or has been significantly involved in current substantive collaborative research activities with a member of staff closely involved in the delivery, management or assessment of the programme(s) or modules in question within the last three years\nVI.\nformer staff or students of the institution unless a period of five years has elapsed and all students taught by or with the external examiner have completed their programme(s)\nVII.\na reciprocal arrangement involving cognate programmes at another institution\nVIII.\nthe succession of an external examiner by a colleague from the examiner’s home department and institution\nIX.\nthe appointment of more than one external examiner from the same department of the same institution.\n5.2\nNo external examiner may be reappointed for the same or similar course within five years of finishing their previous appointment. Such reappointments will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances, with the approval of Quality and Standards Committee (QSC).\n5.3\nExternal examiners should normally hold no more than one other external examinership during the period of their appointment.\n6. Confirmation and period of appointment\n6.1\nExternal Examiners can be appointed on an annual basis up to a normal maximum of four years.  However, this period can be exceptionally extended by one year to ensure continuity, for example where a programme is being brought to an end. To extend an appointment, a written statement with reasons for the extension should be submitted for the approval of Quality and Standards Committee (QSC).\n6.2\nEvery new external examiner will receive a formal letter of appointment from Registry and Academic Affairs, Quality and Student Management System Team setting out the period of office, the programme(s) and/or module(s) to be examined, specific responsibilities and the fee. External examiners will also be given the link to the University’s Code of Practice for External Examiners and a web page containing relevant information.\n7. Details of external examiner appointments\nIncludes:\nresponsibilities of the Head of School; external examiners' report availability\n7.1\nThe Head of School is required to ensure that the name, position and institution of external examiners is provided to students in programme and module information (which may be via the publication of examiners’ reports in the Student Staff Forum or equivalent). This information will also include a statement where an external examiner has been appointed to fulfil a role on behalf of a professional body.\n7.2\nSchools should ensure that external examiners’ reports are made available in full to students, with the sole exception of any confidential report made directly, and separately, to the Vice-Chancellor. For this reason external examiners will be asked not to identify any individual students or staff by name in their reports.\n7.3\nSchools should ensure that their students are informed that it is inappropriate for them to contact external examiners direct, and that other appropriate mechanisms are available for them to raise concerns regarding their individual performance in assessments, for example the Appeals or Complaints procedures.\n8. Preparation of external examiners for their role\nIncludes:\nresponsibility of Registry and Academic Affairs; appointments with no previous experience; responsibilities of the Head of School\n8.1\nRegistry and Academic Affairs ensures that all external examiners are\ninformed about the University’s procedures and policy which may be by provision of an opportunity to attend a University induction event, and the value accorded by the institution to the feedback from external examiners as part of the University’s broader system of quality assurance and enhancement.\n8.2\nWhere the individual appointed has no previous experience as an external examiner for any institution, the School should ensure that the appointment is, if practicable, made to a team of examiners, or that with prior agreement a more experienced external examiner will act as a mentor. The School should ensure that all external examiners newly appointed should be given the opportunity to attend an induction event, to allow them to become familiar with the University and its assessment procedures.\n8.2\nHeads of School are responsible for ensuring that external examiners are given the relevant material they require, such as programme specifications, marking conventions, degree classification information, information on the course structure, syllabus, module details (where appropriate), a copy of the previous external examiner’s final report and relevant University Regulations. Where appropriate, information about fitness to practice procedures should also be included. They are also responsible for ensuring that external examiners are given adequate time to carry out the role.\n9. Detailed responsibilities of external examiners\nIncludes:\nsuitability of type and content of assessments; adherence to assessment procedure; endorsing assessment outcomes; annual written report; adherence to PSRB requirements\n9.1\nExternal Examiners are responsible for assuring the University on the suitability of the type and content of assessments for the subject, the students, the level of study and the learning outcomes being tested.\n9.2\nExternal Examiners are responsible for assuring the University that the assessment procedures being followed (including marking criteria and marking schemes and the consideration of extenuating circumstances) are fair and reasonable, protect academic standards, and are in line with the University’s own regulations and procedures.\n9.3\nExternal Examiners are responsible for endorsing assessment outcomes. In doing so, they need to be assured that marking criteria have been applied rigorously and fairly and that the awards being made to students reflect the standards set by comparable UK universities. In the event of an External Examiner being unwilling to endorse the outcomes of an assessment process, the matter should be referred to the Registrar.\n9.4\nExternal Examiners are responsible for providing the University with an annual written report in compliance with the standard requirements outlined in the report form and a final summary report at the end of their appointment.\n9.5\nWhere there are Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Bodies (PSRB) requirements outside of the normal PSRB-led processes (e.g. there is a requirement for an annual report to the PSRB from the External Examiner), External Examiners are responsible for assuring the university on adherence to Professional Statutory and Regulatory Body requirements.\n10. Powers of external examiners\nIncludes:\naccess to documents; information about assessment procedures; meetings with staff and students; access to examination scripts, coursework and other marked assessments; right to attend meetings; Board decisions and validity implications\n10.1\nExternal Examiners must have whatever access they deem necessary to any documents (including drafts of examination papers, coursework titles or other forms of assessment) with a view to discharging their responsibilities in 9.1 and (where applicable) 9.5 of the previous section.\n10.2\nExternal Examiners must be provided with information about assessment procedures and other procedures sufficient for discharging their responsibilities in 9.2 and (where applicable) 9.5 of the previous section. Any queries External Examiners may have about assessment procedures should be answered in a timely, accurate and comprehensive fashion.\n10.3\nExternal Examiners may request meetings with groups of staff and students from the Nottingham and international campuses (eg via video-conferencing) in order to contextualise their judgements. Any reasonable requests of this kind should be facilitated as far as is practicable.  Where it is not logistically possible to meet international campus students annually, an opportunity should be given a minimum of once every three years.\n10.4\nExternal Examiners must have whatever access they deem necessary to examination scripts, completed coursework and other marked student assessments with a view to discharging their responsibilities in 9.3 and (where applicable) 9.5 of the previous section. External Examiners should not normally be involved in adjusting individual marks either prior to, or at the examination board, unless there are exceptional circumstances, for example in cases where a poor question has been included on an examination paper, to compensate for which all the marks for the whole suite of answer papers need to be raised by a certain percentage.\n10.5\nExternal Examiners have the right to attend meetings of Boards of Examiners and this will normally be necessary in order to discharge their responsibilities. Attendance can be either in person or virtually (e.g. via video-conferencing).\n10.6\nDecisions of the Board of Examiners are not valid unless formally endorsed by an External Examiner.  If particular circumstances arise in regard to individual students that delay a decision on their assessment outcome (i.e. beyond the date of the Board of Examiners’ meeting), the External Examiner may delegate endorsement of the final decision to the Chair of the Board of Examiners.\n11. External examiner's report\nIncludes:\nrequirements; Microsoft Forms report, annual report, final summary report; submission and contact details; next steps\n11.1\nThe External Examiner is required to provide an annual report in a digital format, and a final summary report at the end of the period of appointment via Microsoft Forms.  The report form is available on request from the email address below.  More information on External Examiners for taught programmes can be found on the link:\nExternal examiners for taught programmes\n11.2\nThe External Examiner's report should be submitted through Microsoft forms to Registry and Academic Affaris, Quality and Student Management Systems Team, who will then arrange for the fee due to be paid.\nThe report form is available on request by emailing:\nexternal-examiners@nottingham.ac.uk\n11.3\nRegistry and Academic Affairs, Quality and Student Management Team will forward copies of the report to the Head of School (for action).\n12. Format of the external examiner's report\nIncludes:\nreport explicitly on standards, assessments and awards; may also make a written report on confidential matters\n12.1\nIn their Report, the External Examiner is asked to report explicitly on standards, assessments and awards using the standardised report form provided and to draw attention in particular to any good practice, or areas requiring attention. If, to fulfil additional PSRB requirements as indicated in Section 9.5 (in the responsibilities of external examiners section above), additional information is required this should be submitted as supplementary material to the main report.\n12.2\nThe External Examiner may also make a written report on confidential matters to the Vice-Chancellor.  In exceptional cases, where the concern is systemic and not a one-off case of ineffective practice, and the external examiner has exhausted all published applicable internal procedures, including the submission of a confidential report to the Vice-Chancellor, the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA)’s concerns scheme or relevant professional, statutory or regulatory body, may be informed.\nMore information on making a complaint to the QAA can be found here:\nQAA - how to make a complaint\n13. Dealing with the external examiner's report\nIncludes:\nSchool responsibilities; opportunities for feedback; circulation; communication requirements; responsibilities of Quality and Standards Committee\n13.1\nIt is the School's responsibility to ensure that the annual and final reports comply with the standard requirements outlined in the report form and are available to, and considered by the School's Student Staff Forum or equivalent, and Quality and Standards Committee (QSC). If an external examiner fails to submit an annual report within a reasonable period of time, this may constitute grounds for not re-appointing the external examiner in a subsequent year.\n13.2\nTo assist Schools in fulfilling their responsibility, Registry and Academic Affairs, Quality and Student Management SystemsTeam will notify them annually of any outstanding reports.\n13.3\nThe School should provide an opportunity for the external examiner(s) to give feedback arising from the performance of his/her duties, which may be either or oral or written, and for the School to provide information to the examiner(s) on how the School has addressed issues raised in any previous report(s) from the examiner(s).\n13.4\nWhere programmes are offered at the International Campuses, Schools should ensure that a copy of the external examiner report is available to the International Campus and that there is International Campus involvement in the response submitted to the external examiner and University.\n13.5\nSubsequently the School will forward each report of an external examiner, together with the written report on how the School has addressed the issues raised in it, to Registry and Academic Affiars, Quality and Student Management Systems Team.\n13.6\nIt is the duty of the School to ensure that any external professional body is informed if their requirements form the subject of an external examiner’s report.\n13.7\nA letter is to be sent to each external examiner by the School on the actions or otherwise which have resulted from the report. A copy of each letter should be forwarded to Registry and Academic Affairs, Quality and Student Managment Systems Team.\n13.8\nIt is the duty of the QSC to assure itself that any comments or recommendations of an external examiner have been addressed by the School, and if it is not satisfied, to seek to resolve the matter through a dialogue with the School.\nExceptional regulations applied in response to Covid-19\nPlease be aware that the following Exceptional Regulations were developed and applied during academic year 2019/20 in response to the coronavirus pandemic. These records applied to all of the University's campuses and should be read in conjunction with all other content on this page.\nCovid-19 External Examiner Extensions\nThe active application of these arrangements then ceased at the beginning of academic year 2020/21 (except for exceptional cases to help with continuity purposes in academic year 2020/21 only). Any outcomes from their application during academic year 2019/20 will, however, continue to be honoured and used in all decisions regarding those affected.\nFor more information about the Exceptional Regulations as a whole, please consult the following:\nExceptional Regulations: Covid-19 - 2019/20 - 2020/21\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n23 October 2024||"

Its content is applicable to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Essential information\nIncludes:\nstandard deadline for submission of coursework; deduction of marks upon expiry\nThe standard deadline for submission of coursework on all campuses should be 15:00 local time.\nAs a response to COVID-19 deadlines may be varied and students will be advised where this applies to them.\nA deduction of five percentage points i.e. 5% of the maximum possible mark (100%) shall be imposed upon expiry of the deadline, and an additional 5% per subsequent 24 hour period (weekends and University closure days do not count as days where a 5% is to be imposed).\nFor example, an original mark of 67% would be successively reduced to 62%, 57%, 52%, 47% etc. It is understood that, exceptionally, there may be academic grounds for different penalties to apply.\nPolicy\nIncludes:\nuniversity procedure for coursework submitted late; penalty for late submission; extensions when a student is likely to miss a deadline; assessment regulations\nThe University follows the following procedure when coursework is submitted late:\n1.\nWhen coursework (including essays, laboratory reports, projects, performance or other similar activities) is to constitute part of the whole of the assessment for a module, students should be told in writing at the start of the module the deadline by which the coursework is to be submitted and the penalty for late submission. Deadlines should be set taking account of student workload,and must avoid the revision period. (In certain cases, deadlines during the examination period may be acceptable.)  Friday deadlines should be avoided where practicable.\n2.\nIf coursework is submitted late without a valid extenuating circumstance claim being approved, it should be marked in the normal way, and a penalty then applied. For the benefit of the student, external examiners and others, the original mark and the penalised mark should both be clearly indicated to the student when work is returned. The pre-penalty mark should be used as part of the School/Department’s feedback and moderation processes and the post-penalty mark should be used in any progression or award calculation and will appear on a student’s Transcript or Diploma Supplement. To minimise disputes about timing or submission, coursework should be date-stamped and receipted in some way.\n3.\nThe standard University penalty for late submission should be 5% per day, until the mark reaches zero.\nA deduction of 5% of the actual mark achieved shall be imposed upon expiry of the deadline, and an additional 5% per subsequent 24 hour period (weekends and University closure days do not count as days where a 5% is to be imposed). It is understood that, exceptionally, there may be academic grounds for different penalties to apply, with the approval of the Head of School/Department, for example, when solutions are to be discussed on a particular date, so that work submitted after this date is essentially worthless.\n4.\nThe standard penalties are intended to be very easy to understand, to be sufficiently severe to discourage deliberate late submission (bargaining the penalty against potential improvements to the work), but to encourage late submission in preference to no submission. Any different penalties should, if possible have the same intentions.\n5.\nA student who is likely to miss a deadline should discuss their situation as early as possible with their personal tutor and with the member of staff responsible for the coursework. Extensions to deadlines should not be allowed without extenuating circumstances to ensure fairness to those students who do manage to complete their assignments in good time the procedures laid down under the Assessment Regulations and Extenuating Circumstances policy should be followed.\n6.\nThe application of a late penalty may mean that a student fails the relevant piece of work and/or module and this may affect the student’s overall average for the relevant stage of their programme of study so that reassessment is necessary before the student can be considered for progression or award.\n7.\nIn circumstances where students have the right to a reassessment as outlined in the relevant undergraduate or postgraduate study regulations, Schools/Departments will determine the form of reassessment.\n8.\nSchools/Departments may, where without penalty the work is a pass and/or where it is not appropriate to set a new piece of work use the pre-penalty mark as the reassessment mark at the exam board instead of requiring the student to take further assessment. The pre-penalty mark will be utilised for progression purposes only.   The decision on whether or not it is appropriate to set a new piece of work is at School discretion and based on the pedagogy or duration of a particular assessment.\nFor more information about the assessment regulations, please consult the following:\nAssessment regulations\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n23 January 2023||"

This may include the use of computers in examinations.\n1\nor equivalent at University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) or University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC).\nIllegible handwriting is not something Disability Support Services can assess or support. Students are advised to speak to their personal tutor, regarding support in this area. It is anticipated that this approach reduces to a minimum the number of cases of illegible examination scripts. Where an illegible examination script is received, the procedure outlined in the Procedure for candidate typing transcripts section should be followed.\nFor more information about Disability Support Services, please consult the following:\nDisability Support Services\nProcedure for candidate typing transcripts\nIncludes:\nrestrictions; costs\nThe candidate should not introduce any unauthorised materials into the room and examination conditions should be observed.\nCandidates should be told that they should not attempt to omit or include any words that were not in the original script.\nThe transcript can be typed by the candidate under supervision, or by an appropriate member of staff with the candidate dictating.\nAny costs incurred in the production of the transcript should be borne by the candidate.\nCoursework\nWherever possible, Schools should request that all coursework is\nword-processed.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n09 October 2024||"

Its content is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Introduction and School responsibilities\nMarking by numbers (or anonymous marking) for all formal written examinations was adopted throughout the University from the 1996/97 session. An outline of the system is given in the next section.\nSchools should ensure that students are given information regarding where in the assessment process anonymity ends. As a minimum, anonymity should normally be retained until marking and internal moderation has been completed.\nSystem outline\n1.\nAll formal written examinations should be included with the exception of multiple choice papers marked by Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) where marking by number is not appropriate. The system does not apply to pieces of coursework or class tests, although Schools may decide to devise a way of including these.\n2.\nThe student ID number is used to identify students.\n3.\nAnswer books with a fold-down flap under which the candidate's name is written are used. Using this type of answer book provides a safe method of marking by number as the name on each script can be revealed if necessary.\n4.\nThe name is revealed following agreement of a mark. There are various ways of doing this: the flap need not be opened as a list of names and numbers provided electronically from Campus Solutions can be used to transcribe marks. Marks considered at the Examiners' meeting will be listed by name so that extenuating circumstances may easily be reported.\n5.\nIn the examination room there will be two copies of the attendance register, one with name and number and the other with number only.  The numbers only register must be enclosed with the scripts for use within the School, while the name and number register will be returned to the Examinations Office with the attendance cards. This procedure is outlined clearly in the notes for invigilators which is circulated to all Schools a few weeks before the examination period.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n08 April 2022||"

Introductory meetings for all new full-time students must be arranged by schools within their first two working days at the University, and for part-time students as soon as is reasonably practical.\nWithin the induction process, Schools must ensure that all of their students are provided with:\nAn opportunity to declare any disability\nRequired health and safety information\nGuidance on their course and module choices\nGuidance on progression and degree award regulations, academic offence matters, and appeals and complaints procedures\nA student handbook and other materials as may be appropriate incorporating the above information\nAll undergraduate and taught postgraduate students must be provided with information on personal tutoring or academic guides (as appropriate) in their school/unit, including information on the role of their personal tutor/academic guide, how they can benefit from participation in the programme, the scheduling of meetings, and who to contact if their personal tutor/academic guide is not available.\nAll undergraduate and taught postgraduate students must be provided with information on who their personal tutor/academic guide is and how to contact them\nSchools are also reminded that induction is not solely a Welcome Week activity.\n2.2 Outcomes of Tutoring/academic guide systems\nEach School is required to produce a written statement of its arrangements for achieving outcomes of tutoring/academic guide systems (whether by tutor system or academic guide system) for all of its undergraduate and taught postgraduate students.\nThis written statement may be an account of how each of the individual outcomes is achieved or may comprise a general description of how tutoring/academic guides works within a School (perhaps taken directly from the student handbook) with a commentary or mapping exercise on how these arrangements secure the outcomes of tutoring/academic guides.\nA prime purpose of these statements is to identify practices in Schools that have a positive impact on students’ academic experience and that lend themselves to wider adoption.\nThese statements must be made available to all students, either through inclusion in student handbooks or by other suitable means, such as the online Student Staff Forum (SSFs).\nThese outcomes apply whether the student falls into the personal tutoring or academic guide system; they are:\nStudents feel acknowledged, recognised and accepted within their School or department as an individual with distinct academic needs and preferences\nStudents feel part of the School or department community, experiencing frequent contact with academic staff on an individual or small group basis and building relations with particular members of staff over an extended period\nThe personal development of the student is be promoted;

Its contents are primarily directed at students and tutors/academic guides but may also be of interest to staff across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.1.0 Purpose\nThis page provides guidance on the role and responsibilities of the Personal Tutor system, including about effective delivery and roles and responsibilities of tutors and students. It also contains links to the alternative Academic Guide system.\n2.0 Key Principles\n2.1 Academic Guides system\nSince the academic year 2023/24, some students are allocated to small interdisciplinary tutoring teams consisting of both staff and student representatives, instead of individual personal tutors.\nIn 2024/25 these students are first and second year undergraduate students in the Schools of Psychology (UK & UNM) and Law (UK), as well as postgraduate taught students in the Schools of Psychology (UK) and Computer Science (UK), first-year undergraduate students in the Nottingham University Business School (UK) and qualifying-year undergraduate students in the School of Education and English (UNNC).\nWhere 'personal tutor' is referred to within the Quality Manual, for the students detailed above, this includes the academic guides (also known as the 'here for you guides').\nThe link to full details about the Academic Guide system can be found in the 'Related Regulations, Policies and Procedures' section below.\n2.2 Personal tutoring expectations\n2.2.1 Undergraduate (UG) students\nEvery undergraduate student must be allocated a personal tutor by their School or unit at the start of their course. For Joint Honours students the personal tutor must be appointed by the lead School or unit. However, these students must also have a Joint Honours advisor in the other School who meets with the student at least twice per year (individually or in a group), particularly to assist with subject specific module choice and feedback.\nPersonal tutors must be academic/clinical academic members of staff (or, with the approval of the University Senior Tutor, members of the Administrative, Professional and Management (APM) job family at Level 4 or above). Note that in the UK, clinical lecturers, practitioner health lecturers, NHS mentors and social work practice learning tutors or equivalent can be personal tutors.\nSchools must ensure that appropriate allowance is made in the Work Load Plan (WLP) for the staff-time necessary for effective personal tutoring and the administration involved in being an effective personal tutor.\nSchools must ensure that students are informed of where they can seek assistance if their personal tutor is unavailable. In most cases, this would be the Senior Tutor.\n2.2.2 Postgraduate taught (PGT) students\nEvery taught postgraduate student (whether full or part time, on a professional course, or on a distance learning course) must be allocated a personal tutor and informed of this at the start of their course. In particular, Schools must ensure that PGT personal tutoring programmes provide:\nReview of feedback from early progress checks and advice and guidance on how to support the tutee’s development\nOpportunity to participate in the personal and professional developmental opportunities available at Nottingham\n2.2.3 Postgraduate research (PGR) students\nPGR students must receive personal and academic support from their supervisor and from their School Postgraduate Student Adviser.\n2.3 Personal Tutor meetings\nThere will be a clear stage appropriate developmental agenda for every personal tutor meeting, with appropriate time for reflection and action planning/goal setting around the following areas, in addition to discipline specific activity:\nWellbeing\nHealth\nInterests and hobbies\nAcademic development and progress\nPlanning and organisation\nFinance\nCareers/employability\nSkills acquisition\nThese personal tutor meetings must include goal setting and action planning.\nPersonal, professional and employability developmental goals may relate to any area of potential achievement other than those for which students are explicitly provided with an assessment grade or academic award.\nBy setting, achieving and reflecting on their academic performance and their personal, professional and employability developmental goals with their personal tutor, students may be assisted in maximising their experience in their time at the University of Nottingham, and may improve both their employability prospects and their general wellbeing.\nIt is suggested that the best goals will be simple, tangible, memorable and achievable.\nExamples of some goals include:\nParticipation in the Nottingham Advantage Award (NAA)\nInvestigating work placement or final employment options and identifying possible companies to apply to\nUndertaking a volunteering activity\nHelping to run a student society\nBecoming a member of a hall of residence committee or team\nLearning about another society or culture\nImproving writing or research skills\nIncreasing levels of tutorial academic contribution\nIdentifying and applying for study abroad or campus mobility options\nDeveloping ideas for a dissertation topic\nIn addition, personal wellbeing goals may include:\nSeeking help – for example, attending a counselling service workshop, meeting with the welfare team, or seeing a General Practitioner (GP)\nExploring online support apps such as Headspace and other wellbeing resources\nDoing some exercise and re-engaging with an activity previously enjoyed\nIncreasing social activity and keeping up with family and friends\n2.4 Role and responsibilities of personal tutors\nAs part of their School’s student support, development and personal tutoring programme, all personal tutors in the University of Nottingham are expected to support, encourage and guide those registered students who are their tutees so that they are supported in maximising their academic potential, personal development, and professional and employability skills acquisition throughout their time as a registered student at the University.\nPersonal tutors can enable their tutees to achieve this by helping them to review their progress regularly by encouraging self-appraisal and self-development strategies, by helping them to identify learning needs or goals and monitor their progress towards achieving their goals, as well as by exploring developmental opportunities available both within and outside the University. The personal tutor will also act as a gateway to the wider support and development provision at the University.\nPersonal tutors are not expected to be able to advise on all matters of personal and professional development and support. They are, however, expected to have sufficient knowledge of their School and the wider University so that they can help students to find the assistance they require. Such information will be made available to them, either by way of training or through their Senior Tutor.\nUpon appointment as a personal tutor, they are expected to undertake appropriate induction and training and thereafter attend refresher training on a biennial basis (either by way of Professional Development events or something which has been organised by the School or department Senior Tutor).\nWhere personal tutor meetings are not timetabled, personal tutors are expected to be available to meet/make contact for a developmental and personal tutoring meeting with their tutees at least three times per academic year (once per term). In addition to this, for first year undergraduate students, an additional introductory meeting/contact must be arranged, ordinarily within the first two weeks of the first term. For postgraduate taught (PGT) students, or students on placement or exchange, this contact need not be face-to-face and can be completed by way of email, MS-Teams, telephone or other.\nIn addition to these scheduled meetings or contact, personal tutors must ensure that their tutees are able to contact them for additional guidance and support.\nPersonal tutors must inform the Senior Tutor if their students are not participating in the personal tutoring programme and are not meeting or contacting them\nPersonal tutoring meetings or contact will provide an opportunity for the personal tutor to encourage their student’s developmental action planning/goal setting and reflection on performance, skills acquisition and employability\nPersonal tutors are expected to challenge their students to make the most of their experience at the University of Nottingham. In part, if appropriate, they will do this by pointing out the wide range of opportunities made available by the University (for example, through the Nottingham Advantage Award (NAA), and the Careers and Employability Service)\nAll personal tutors are expected to be familiar with the University’s guidance for personal tutors, as well as their own School or department's supplementary guidance, and to keep informed of any updates to this material\nPersonal tutors are expected to provide their tutees with references for employment and further studies\nPersonal tutors must record and share relevant notes and information with their tutees, in due course this will be via the advisory note facility on Campus Solutions student record system\n2.5 Student engagement with personal tutoring\nAll students need to appreciate that a successful undergraduate or postgraduate career will involve more than passing assessments to achieve a University award. The University (both centrally and at a School level) provides a wide range of support and development services to assist students in difficulty, as well as to improve the wellbeing, personal and academic development, understanding of University practices, employability and sense of community of every student. However, it is the responsibility of every student to gain an adequate knowledge of what services are available to and appropriate for them, and to make use of these services as their individual needs and circumstances require.\nIn particular, students must make all reasonable efforts to prepare for and attend all scheduled meetings with their personal tutor, and to keep their personal tutor informed of their personal development progress.\nStudents are reminded that they are likely to require references for employment or further study from their personal tutor, and that it is unreasonable to expect their personal tutor to be able to supply an adequate reference if they have not engaged in a reasonable level of interaction with them.\nStudents must keep their School informed of circumstances that may impact on their progress and which may require personal support at either a School or University level.\n2.6 School's responsibility regarding Senior Tutors\nEach School should appoint an appropriately experienced academic member of staff to act as a Senior Tutor and should keep the University Senior Tutor and the Deputy University Senior Tutor informed of the role holder. If they wish, Schools may decide to appoint multiple Senior Tutors with responsibility for different groups of students (for example, undergraduates or postgraduates) or different units or divisions within their School if they feel that this will improve their overall delivery of student support and development.\nAppropriate Work Load Planning (WLP) time should be allocated to effectively perform this role.\n2.7 Evaluation of personal tutoring\nEach school must take steps to monitor the effectiveness of its arrangements for the provision of student support and development. The Senior Tutor(s) will take a lead role in undertaking this monitoring.\nIt is the responsibility of the University Senior Tutor to monitor the operation of student support and development across the University and to bring issues of concern to relevant University committees.\nAdditionally, one aspect of the University's Periodic Assurance and Continuous Enhancement Review (PACER) is to determine whether adequate overall provision is made for student support and development support. Central support services providing student support and development are also subject to periodic reviews by the University.\n3.0 Related Regulations, Policies and Procedures\nFor more information about the Academic Guide system, please consult the following:\nAcademic Guides\nFor more information about the role and responsibilities of the School Postgraduate Student Advisor, please consult the following:\nResponsibilities of the Postgraduate Student Advisor\nResponsibilities of the School\nFor more information about the role and responsibilities of Senior Tutors, please consult the following:\nRole and responsibilities of Senior Tutors\nFor more information about the monitoring and review processes, please consult the following:\nProgramme monitoring and review\n4.0 Version Control Table\nVersion Control Table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nReformatted to align with new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework based on content last modified on 11/10/2024\nQSC\nFebruary 2025\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n24 February 2025||"

It is the student’s responsibility to see that the selected combination of modules accords with the regulations for their course.\nThe University retains the right not to award marks for coursework or to allow students to sit examinations for modules for which they are not formally registered.\nThe 'Courses' tab on the MyNottingham Portal, available to all students, reflects the information held on the University’s central student records system; MyNottingham also provides guidance on how to rectify incorrect data. In order for a student formally to be entered for an examination, MyNottingham must accurately reflect the student's module enrolments.\nIt is the responsibility of students to ensure that MyNottingham contains the correct information prior to the publication of the definitive examination timetable.\nFormal approval\nIncludes:\ncompulsory modules; other choices; review; issues regarding submission\nStudents will be enrolled automatically onto any compulsory modules which form part of their programme of study.\nStudents must select all other choices through the online module enrolment system when instructed to do so, ensuring they are selecting modules that meet the requirements of their programme of study. The online system will apply checks as the choices are made and the submission cannot be made if certain requirements are not met.\nAfter submission, a further review of choices is made by staff.\nShould a student be contacted regarding issues with their submission, these must be rectified by students immediately.\nChange of mind period\nIncludes:\nautumn semester; spring semester; restrictions\nTo provide students with an opportunity to change the modules they are studying, the University allows for the following two-week ‘change of mind’ periods.\nAutumn Semester – there will be two weeks allocated around the start of session to change previously selected modules. Students are able to change any (autumn, spring or full-year) optional modules.\nSpring Semester – there will be two weeks allocated around the start of the spring semester. At this point, students can only change spring semester optional modules.\nDuring these periods, students are able to change their module choices through the online module enrolment system, which will be reopened during these periods.\nStudents are not permitted to register for additional modules in order to compensate for a perceived poor performance in previous modules.\nExceptional amendments\nIncludes:\nExceptional Amendment Form; responsibilities; subsequent requests to change; extenuating circumstances procedure\nAfter these ‘change of mind’ periods, a change to a module registration will only be accepted in exceptional circumstances and where the choice is formally approved – that is, approval from the school offering the module and from the student’s home school.\nTo do so, the student must complete the following form:\nExceptional Amendment Form\nIt is the student’s responsibility to ensure that any requests to exceptionally change a module are notified to their school or department immediately. This notification is via the completion of the form above. Only one module change request per form is permitted.\nThe University reserves the right to give marks only for modules that the student is formally enrolled on. In cases where the student has failed to notify the change via the form a mark of zero may be awarded for the module a student is enrolled on, even though they have studied and successfully completed another module, on which they are not registered.\nSubsequent requests to change\nRequests to change a module registration once the majority of the teaching for the module has been delivered (in the case of year-long modules this will apply when the majority of teaching in the initial semester has been delivered) must be approved by Quality and Standards Committee (QSC).\nSuch changes would only be possible when there are extenuating circumstances. In such cases, please note the following:\nThe home school will make the case on behalf of the student directly to QSC\nIf the change is agreed the Registry and Academic Affairs Programmes team will be notified and will update the student record.\nFor more information about what kind of circumstances are permissible, please consult the following Student Services page:\nExtenuating circumstances\nRegistering for additional credits\nIncludes:\nnormal expectations; exceptional procedure; confirmation; important information for students; student fees and finance\nThe normal expectation is that registered students of the University enrol for modules in accordance with the appropriate University regulations and programme specification. Exceptionally, however, a student may be allowed to register for a maximum of 20 credits of additional credit-bearing modules in any one academic year (see 9e below).\nWhen a student wishes to undertake a module(s) that cannot be accommodated on the course on which they are registered, the following procedure will apply:\n1.\nThe student should initially approach their school to confirm that the module(s) they wish to undertake cannot be accommodated on their degree course. For students registered on a joint honours degree, the school with overall administrative responsibility (the ‘lead’ school) for the course should be approached.\n2.\nIf the module(s) cannot be accommodated within the structure of the degree course, the student will be allowed to take them in addition to their degree course credits.\n3.\nThe student’s school should confirm the details of the additional module(s) that the student wishes to study to the home Student Services programmes team.\n4.\nIf the module specification specifies a maximum number of available places, the school offering the module should always give priority to students who need or wish to take that module(s) as part of their degree course. It is for this reason that a student wishing to undertake an additional module(s) may have to wait until the normal module enrolment process has been completed before knowing for definite that they may enrol for such additional study.\n5.\nUpon receipt of the request from the school, Student Services staff will add these additional modules to the student’s record and arrange for a pro rata tuition fee to be charged to the student.\n6.\nOnce the student has completed the assessment for the additional module(s) as outlined in the module specification (i.e. submitted the coursework and/or sat the examination), the school offering the module(s) should inform the Student Service Centre so that the module(s) may be deleted from the student’s record to allow marks processing to operate as normal.\n7.\nIf the student does not pass the module upon their first attempt, the offering school reserves the right to refuse a reassessment opportunity. If a reassessment opportunity is granted, the student will be charged the appropriate reassessment fee.\n8.\nIf the student requires written confirmation of any details relating to the additional module(s), this should be provided by the school offering the module(s).\n9.\nStudents should note that:\n(a)\nundertaking additional credits is done entirely at their own risk;\n(b)\nany effect of the workload associated with the additional module(s) will not be accepted as an extenuating circumstance in relation to performance on their degree course;\n(c)\nany credits awarded for the additional module(s) will not appear on the final transcript. Confirmation of any details associated with the additional module(s) is carried out exclusively by the school(s) offering the module(s) (8 above);\n(d)\nany credits awarded for the additional module(s) will not be counted when determining either progression entitlement or an award of the University (including interim awards), irrespective of the student’s performance in such a module(s);\n(e)\nthe maximum number of additional modules is limited to 20 credits per academic year and no more than 15 credits in any one semester.\nFurther information\nMore information on reassessment fees can be found here:\nStudent fees and finance - tuition fees\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n29 January 2025||"

This information is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Introduction\nIncludes:\ninfluences; key links; purpose\nThe University of Nottingham Qualifications Framework (UNQF) has been drafted to be fully compatible with the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA)'s Framework for Higher Education Qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as the qualifications framework adopted at the Bergen Summit of the Bologna Process for the creation of a European Higher Education Area.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nThe QAA Quality Code\nEuropean Higher Education Area\nHow does the Bologna process work?\nProgramme specifications based on the QAA Framework have been formulated for University of Nottingham courses. Building on this work, a University of Nottingham Qualifications Framework (the UNQF) has been devised to underpin future course approval and review activity.\nThe purposes of the UNQF are to:\nHelp applicants, students, employers, and other stakeholders to understand the University’s awards and to place them in context with each other and with the awards of other institutions.\nDemonstrate that appropriate progression occurs between levels before arriving at a final award.\nEnsure an accurate mapping of learning outcomes and assessment to clearly defined levels as proposed in the QAA Code of Practice.\nAssist staff formulating new courses in deciding upon the appropriate structure, title, and final award of those courses.\nFacilitate the integration of Nottingham credits, modules, courses and awards into future European-wide initiatives.\nAvoid difficulties for students in undertaking credit transfer.\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework (UNQF)\nIncludes:\nrelationship to the QAA qualification descriptors; table of credits in total and by stage; table of minimum requirements for award; table of periods of registered study for research awards\n1.\nA University of Nottingham credit equates to 10 hours of notional study. Credits are awarded by the University at the levels described on the Relationship of the University of Nottingham Qualifications Framework (UNQF) to the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) qualification descriptors page, which themselves relate to the QAA qualification descriptors on the QAA Qualification Framework page.\nThe notional equivalent hours of study may not be directly applicable to University of Nottingham apprenticeship programmes where work-based learners have additional contextual opportunities to embed and test learning. Programme approval processes will ensure teaching approaches meet required outcomes for the learners on apprenticeships.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nRelationship of the UNQF to the QAA qualification descriptors\nThe Quality Assurance Agency Qualification Framework\n2.\nThe number and level of credits which need to be gained for each taught award of the University is as follows:\nCredits in Total and by Stage\nTable of Credits in Total and by Stage\nQualification\nCredits\nStage\nPeriod of Registered Study (full-time).    Approval may be given for these lengths to be varied for individual programmes\nFoundation Certificate (FCert)\n120 credits at level 0 or above\n2 semesters\nUndergraduate Certificate (UGCert)\n120 credits at level 1 or above\n2 semesters\nUndergraduate Diploma (UGDip)\n240 credits with at least 90 credits at level 2 or above\nQualifying Stage: 120 credits at level 1 or above\nPart I: 120 credits with at least 90 credits at level 2 or above\n1 year 9 months\nOrdinary Degree\n300 credits with at least 60 credits at level 3\nPart I: 100 credits with at least 80 credits at level 2 or above\nPart II: 100 credits with at least 60 credits at level 3\n2 years 9 months\nGraduate Certificate (GCert)\n60 credits with at least 40 credits at level 3 or above\n1 semester\nGraduate Diploma (GDip)\n120 credits with at least 90 credits at level 3 or above\n2 semesters\nHonours Degree (Hons)*\n*These requirements also apply to the award of an unclassified ('Pass') degree at the end of an honours course\n360 credits** with at least 190 credits at level 2 or above and at least 100 credits at level 3 or above\n** This will be 480 credits for the Bachelor of Education course run at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC) and for the Bachelor of Pharmacy course run at the University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM).\nQualifying Stage: 120 credits at level 1 or above\nPart I: 120 credits with at least 90 credits at level 2 or above\nPart II: 120 credits with at least 100 credits at level 3 or above\n2 years 9 months\nIntegrated Masters\n480 credits with at least 290 credits at level 2 or above, 200 credits at level 3 or above, and 120 credits at level 4\nQualifying Stage: 120 credits at level 1 or above\nPart I: 120 credits with at least 90 credits at level 2 or above\nPart II: 120 credits with at least 100 credits at level 3 or above\nPart III: 120 credits with at least 90 credits at level 4 and a further 10 credits at level 3 or above\n3 years 9 months\nPostgraduate Certificate (PGCert)\n60 credits with at least 50 credits at level 4\n1 semester\nPostgraduate Diploma (PGDip)\n120 credits with at least 90 credits at level 4\n2 semesters\nTaught Masters Degree\n180 credits with at least 150 credits at level 4\nTaught Stage: 120 credits with at least 90 credits at level 4\nResearch stage: At least 60 credits of the course is devoted to a research project leading to a dissertation/comparable research output or the production of other output such as an artefact, business plan, performance or musical composition.

Its contents are relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses and may also be of interest to prospective students.Overview\nIncludes:\ndefinition; School responsibilities\nRecognition of other learning (ROL) covers all instances where credit towards a University qualification is awarded by the University by means other than enrolling on University modules or participating in formal placement or joint degree arrangements. Please be aware that:\nSchools are responsible for making those who might be eligible for the recognition of prior learning aware of the opportunities available and supporting them through the process of application and assessment for recognition.\nSchools must make their arrangements explicit for making decisions on ROL applications in line with the information within the remaining sections.\nAll decisions should be valid, reliable and consistent across students and programmes and be balanced against operating processes which are proportionate and flexible.\nScope of recognition\nIncludes:\nRecognition of Prior Certified Learning (RPCL); Recognition of Prior Experiential Learning (RPEL); Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL); terminology; Table of ROL contribution towards qualifications\nScope\nRecognition of other learning (ROL) can cover the following aspects:\nRecognition of prior certified learning (RPCL) – that is, recognition given in the form of credits to learning which is certified and at a higher education level but has not led to the award of higher education credits (such as professional development awards or employment-based awards).\nRecognition of prior experiential (or informal) learning (RPEL) – that is, an assessment process on the part of academic staff within the University leads to the recognition of learning gained through vocational or other experience, usually through the award of credit.\nRecognition of prior learning (RPL) – that is, where credits or qualifications have been awarded by a higher education degree-awarding body in accordance with the higher education qualifications framework.\nCredit transfer can be either on the basis of an individual application or as part of a formal arrangement with an external institution.The admitting school determines the status of that award (including considerations of volume and level) as it relates to the programme the applicant wishes RPL to be applied to.\nFor more information, please consult the following page:\nPartnerships and placements\nTerminology\nThe term Recognition of Other Learning (ROL) is used where certified (RPCL), experiential (RPEL) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) are being referred to together.\nThe University places no requirement on schools to grant ROL or to consider ROL applications if a school or programme has a policy of not so doing.\nThe effects of previous research study on the minimum periods of registration for research degrees are contained in the regulations for those degrees. More information can be found here:\nRegulations for PhD and MPhil\nThe expectation is that all elements of a ROL application will be submitted in English except for official certification and where the subject of study is a language or literature other than English.\nThe University’s policy on Partnerships and placements should be referred to for guidance about mark and credit transfer for students on study abroad placements at educational Institutions where this an integral part of their programme of study.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nTable of ROL contribution towards qualifications\nUniversity of Nottingham qualification towards which ROL is granted\nMaximum RPL credits\nMaximum RPCL/RPEL credits\nFoundation Certificate\n80\n40\nUndergraduate Certificate\n80\n40\nUndergraduate Diploma\n160\n80\nOrdinary Degree (Part I only)\n*From 2015/16 this degree is only available as an exit award.\n120\n100\nHonours Degree (Qualifying and Part I only)\n240\n120\nGraduate Certificate\n40\n20\nGraduate Diploma\n80\n40\nIntegrated Masters (Qualifying and Part I only)\n240\n160\nPostgraduate Certificate\n40\n20\nPostgraduate Diploma\n80\n40\nMasters (Taught stage only)\n80\n60\nResearch Master (MRes, MSc (by Research), MA (by Research))\n60\n60\nProfessional doctorates (where the research element is weighted at two-thirds and the taught element weighted at one-third of the programme\n120\n120\nFor more information about changes to availability, please consult the Academic regulations category:\nAcademic regulations\nApplications for ROL\nIncludes:\ndecisions; submission requirements; applications; potential fees\nWhere the learning has occurred prior to the student being admitted to the University, application for Recognition of Other Learning (ROL) should be made before the student first registers with the University as schools may choose not to consider any applications for ROL submitted after admission.\nIt is the student’s responsibility to apply for ROL and to provide all the necessary evidence to support their application.\nDecisions\nDecisions for all applications will be made by the admitting school, which can request any supporting evidence from the student which it deems necessary to reach a decision. The school may also wish to interview the applicant.\nSubmission requirements\nAs a minimum, applicants should include the following information within their submission for ROL (although schools may choose to waive some requirements where the ROL will only count towards the foundation or qualifying stage).\nFor all applications:\nThe number of credits for which ROL is being sought and the stage in the student’s programme at the University (e.g. Qualifying Stage, Part I) against which the credits will be counted.\nAny specific modules or category of modules from which exemption is being sought as a result of the ROL.\nApplications for ROL or Credit Transfer at Entry (CTAE):\nThe title, location, and nature of the institution at which the learning occurred.\nThe dates of attendance at the institution and of any qualifications obtained.\nA statement of the equivalence of any qualifications obtained to levels and qualifications detailed on the University’s qualifications framework page.\nCurriculum details of subjects studied at the institution.\nAn authorised transcript of marks and details of the marking scheme used by the institution.\nFor more information, please consult the following pages:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\nApplications for Recognition of Prior Experiential (or informal) Learning (RPEL):\nAn account of the activities undertaken which have resulted in learning, including the dates and duration of these activities.\nA detailed statement of what has been learned from these activities.\nConfirmation from an employer or other objective source of the activities and learning claimed by the student.\nPotential fees\nSchools may choose to charge a fee for considering a ROL application; such a fee, though, should be kept to a minimum and only be designed to cover the cost of assessing the application. Where fees are charged, these are likely to be higher for an RPEL than for Recognition of Prior Certified Learning (RPCL) or CTAE application.\nApplicants should note that if RPEL is granted, and fewer credits are therefore studied, the resulting tuition fees will be as set out in the University’s fees regulations. Applicants should also note that the reduction in the number of credits being studied may prevent them from having the status of full-time students.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham fees regulations\nFor more information, and to make an application, please consult the following:\nServices for Students - Recognition of Other Learning\nApproving ROL applications\nIncludes:\nschool responsibilities; additional criteria; application for ROL form.\nSchools are responsible for approving Recognition of Other Learning (ROL) applications but should not approve them unless the following criteria are satisfied:\nThe factual statements contained in the application have been substantiated (either by the school or the Admissions Office) such that there is sufficient evidence of the learning claimed and that it is clearly the result of the applicant's own efforts and achievements.\nThe prior learning has taken place in the last ten years (many schools will, of course, require the learning to have occurred much more recently).\nThe student has gained pass marks in those modules or units for which Application of Prior Learning (APL) is being claimed.\nThere is a close match between the prior learning and the level and learning outcomes of those modules which will not be taken as a result of the ROL.\nThe limitations on granting ROL contained in the policy on Limitations on ROL and policy on Double Counting have not been breached.\nThe school may have additional criteria which must also be satisfied. All decisions to grant ROL must be reported to Registry and Academic Affairs by submitting the relevant form and recorded against the student’s academic record.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nServices for Students - Recognition of Other Learning\nInformation to individual ROL applicants\nIncludes:\nUCAS; School responsibilities; decision\nStudents applying for direct entry to Part I via UCAS will receive a decision on their application (by way of UCAS) in the same manner as other applicants.\nStudents applying for Recognition of Other Learning (ROL) should be informed of this by the school and should also be told:\nWhether a fee will be charged for considering an ROL application and the amount of that fee.\nThe information the student will be expected to provide and any deadlines for providing it.\nThe likely timescale for considering the application.\nWhether they will receive feedback on their assessment on either a successful or rejected case.\nAlternatively, the applicant should be told that the school or programme has a policy of not granting ROL, if that is the case.\nDecision\nOnce a decision has been made by the school, the student should be told in writing by the school:\nWhether or not ROL is being granted.\nThe number of credits being awarded, their level, and the stage of the student’s course against which the credits are being counted.\nThe marks which have been attributed to the credits being awarded. Or, in the case of a student receiving ROL for which no marks have been attributed, the arrangements for progression and classification.\nAny specific modules or groups of modules from which the student is being exempted as a result of the ROL.\nAny restrictions on the student’s module choice over and above normal University and supplementary regulations.\nThe written communication containing this information should be copied to Student Services Development (Academic Processes) or equivalent.\nFurther guidance for Schools\nIncludes:\ngroup articulations on ROL; Memorandum of Agreement (MoA); monitoring and review;\nGroup articulations on ROL\nSchools may establish agreements with other educational institutions to grant Recognition of Other Learning (ROL) to groups of applicants to their courses who have obtained a particular qualification or successfully undertaken specified periods of study. Please note the following:\nIn making such an agreement, Schools should, as a minimum, ask for the same information about the learning that students routinely gain from the institution or organisation as is indicated in the previous section.\nIn determining whether to enter into a group ROL agreement, Schools should apply the same criteria as specified in the previous section.\nThe Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) underpinning group ROL should be drafted with reference to the QAA Quality Code for Higher Education Chapter B10 Managing Higher Education Provision with Others and the University’s guidance on MoAs and be submitted to Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) for consideration prior to signature. Details of the students being admitted through such agreements should be reported to Student Services Development or equivalent.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nPartnerships and placements\nQuality and Standards Committee\nMonitoring and review\nAll group ROL agreements should be reviewed by the School as part of periodic Educational Enhancement Assurance Review (EEAR). Statistics relating to the progress and achievement of group ROL students compared to the rest of the cohort should be considered by the School as part of annual monitoring of programmes.\nFor more information about the EEAR process, please consult the following :\nEducational Enhancement and Assurance Review\nLimitations on ROL\nIncludes:\nmaximum amounts; table of maximum ROL contribution towards qualification; academic regulations\nThe maximum amount of Credit Transfer at Entry (CTAE) or Credit Transfer Post Entry (CTPE) which can be awarded towards University of Nottingham undergraduate qualifications is two-thirds of the total credits for the programme.\nThe maximum amount of Recognition of Prior Experiential (or informal) Learning (RPEL) which can be awarded towards University of Nottingham undergraduate qualifications is one-third of the total credits for the programme.\nThe maximum amount of RPEL which can be awarded towards University of Nottingham postgraduate qualifications is two-thirds of the credits for the taught stage of the programme,\nexcept that:\nRPEL cannot be granted towards Part II or equivalent or Part III of an undergraduate programme, nor towards the dissertation stage of a Masters programme.\nIf Recognition of Other Learning (ROL) based on a combination of certified, credited and experiential learning are granted to the same student, the overall number of credits awarded must not exceed the maxima for ROL.\nThe limitations applied to group articulations of CTPE will be set out in the relevant Memorandum of Agreement (MoA).\nROL granted for previous study at Nottingham is not subject to the limitations stated below. For more information, please consult the Double counting section located further down this page.\nROL should only be granted for whole modules or groups of modules.\nThe lower maxima for Recognition of Prior Certified Learning (RPCL) and RPEL credits is a result of the greater distance from this form of learning to that which generally occurs in University of Nottingham modules:\nTable of maximum ROL contribution towards qualifications\nUniversity of Nottingham qualification towards which ROL is granted\nMaximum CTAE/CTPE credits\nMaximum RPCL/RPEL credits\nFoundation Certificate\n80\n40\nUndergraduate Certificate\n80\n40\nUndergraduate Diploma\n160\n80\nOrdinary Degree (Part I only)\n*From 2015/16 this degree is only available as an exit award.\n120\n100\nHonours Degree (Qualifying and Part I only)\n240\n120\nGraduate Certificate\n40\n20\nGraduate Diploma\n80\n40\nIntegrated Masters (Qualifying and Part I only)\n240\n160\nPostgraduate Certificate\n40\n20\nPostgraduate Diploma\n80\n40\nMasters (taught stage only)\n80\n60\nResearch Master (MRes, MSc (by Research), MA (by Research))\n60\n60\nProfessional doctorates (where the research element is weighted at two-thirds and the taught element weighted at one-third of the programme\n120\n120\nFor more information about changes to availability, please consult the following:\nAcademic regulations\nDouble counting\nIncludes:\ngranting of ROL; restrictions; admissions procedures; relevant exceptions; academic procedures\nRecognition of Other Learning (ROL) can be granted for all learning from other educational institutions, even if that learning has already resulted in the award of a qualification similar to, or the same as, the qualification to be awarded to the student by the University of Nottingham.\nSimilarly, the University places no restrictions on other institutions awarding qualifications on the basis of credits or qualifications gained at Nottingham.\nROL towards a University of Nottingham qualification may be granted for learning which has taken place in a previous period of study at the University, even if that learning has led to a Nottingham award. For example a student who has already left with a bachelor's degree may subsequently be allowed to return and take a further year for the award of an Integrated master's degree. No credits below honours level (university level 3) may be used as ROL for a postgraduate programme.\nIn accordance with the admissions procedures, individuals who have previously registered for and been unsuccessful on a course at the University of Nottingham may not apply to the same programme again and the ROL procedure does not apply to such potential candidates.\nROL from a University of Nottingham qualification may not be used to count towards a second Nottingham qualification which is both at the same level and in a similar subject to the first. For example, a student who has left with a BA Honours in Anthropology would not be able to count ROL from this programme towards a second BA Honours in Social Anthropology.\nThe exceptions to this are that a student who has successfully completed a Postgraduate Diploma programme (that is to say, was not awarded a Postgraduate Diploma as a result of failure on a Master's programme) may subsequently be allowed to return and to undertake a dissertation for the award of a Master's degree and that a student who has successfully completed an Integrated master's programme may use credits from that programme towards a postgraduate master's programme subject to approval from the admitting school and to the limitations on ROL above.\nFor more information on double counting, please consult the following:\nAdmissions procedures\nCompensation and classification\nIncludes:\nwhere marks are awarded; where marks are not awarded; partnerships and placements\nWhere marks are awarded\nIn the case of credits gained through Credit Transfer at Entry (CTAE) and Credit Transfer Post Entry (CTPE), marks should, if possible, be attributed to the credits using the same procedure as for marks transfer of exchange students. Marks may also be awarded for Recognition of Prior Certified Learning (RPCL) and Recognition of Prior Experiential (or informal) Learning (RPEL) through appropriate assessment of the student’s portfolio of evidence.\nThe compensation arrangements in the University’s study regulations will, however, only operate on the basis of modules studied at the University. In the case of undergraduate students, for example, a student must have passed 80 credits worth of modules taken at the University of Nottingham in order to be in a position to compensate any modules that have been failed at the University. Marks attributed to credits gained through Recognition of other learning (ROL) will, though, be used to calculate the student’s overall average for both compensation and classification purposes.\nWhere marks are not awarded\nIf the school does not believe it has sufficient information to attribute accurate marks to the credits gained through ROL, the following arrangements are to be followed in determining compensation (for progression purposes) and classification of awards for students:\nIn calculating the weighted average mark for purposes of compensation, only credits derived from modules on which the student has enrolled will be used. For example if a student has received 20 credits of ROL, then the student’s average mark will be obtained by dividing the weighted aggregate mark by just 100 rather than the normal 120. Credits gained through ROL will not count towards the minimum number of credits that must be passed in order for compensation to occur.\nIn calculating the overall weighted average for classification purposes, only credits derived from modules on which the student has enrolled will be used. For example if an honours student has received 20 credits of ROL at Part I, then the student’s Part I average will be obtained by dividing the weighted aggregate mark for Part I by just 100 rather than the normal 120.  If the student is enrolling on less than 100 credits in Part I of an undergraduate programme, the school may decide to set a non-standard Part I/II weighting for that student which allocates a lower than normal weighting to Part I.\nFor more information in regards to exchange students, please consult the following:\nPartnerships and placements\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n27 January 2025||"

        "content": "Programme specification guidance - The University of NottinghamProgramme specification guidance\nThis page provides the regulations on programme specifications. Its content is primarily directed at staff but may also be of interest to students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.1.0 Purpose\nThis page sets out the regulations about programme specifications to help staff who are both updating existing programme specifications as well as designing new ones.  These documents are published to both applicants and current students.\n2.0 Key principles\nA programme specification is required for all programmes on which a student may register (including ordinary degree programmes). There is no requirement for separate programme specifications for awards granted solely due to a student not satisfactorily completing the programme they are registered on.\nFor Postgraduate Certificates and Postgraduate Diplomas, a separate programme specification is only required if direct application is possible. Where the Certificate or Diploma is awarded to students who do not complete a master's programme, their qualifications fall under the programme specification of the corresponding master's degree.\nFor integrated master’s programmes, there is no requirement to produce a bachelor’s degree programme specification if students are effectively 'exiting' with the bachelor’s degree after three years. A programme specification would only be required if students can transfer to a bachelor's degree programme at an earlier point, and are registered for a period  before receiving their degree.\nThe University has endorsed seven principles for good curriculum design. Schools are asked to review the principles in the Curriculum design document as they design programmes.\nNew Programme Design Principles\nPlease note, University policies and procedures outlined in University Regulations and the Quality Manual apply automatically to all programmes. Therefore, please do not reproduce or summarise the content of University regulations or the Quality Manual in a programme specification.\n2.1 Basic information\n2.1.1 Title\nSpecify the qualification (e.g. BA, BSc, MA and others) and the subject title (e.g. Applied Linguistics) that will be reflected on students' degree certificates and transcripts. These will appear on students’ degree certificates and transcripts in this form.\nIn the case of bachelors' degrees, please specify whether the qualification is with honours or ordinary.\nPlease note no two programmes can share the same name.\nFor 2-year Masters, the title must include (2yr) appearing on the end of the title to make a clear distinction between other variations of Masters course. This will only appear on programmes of 240 credits. Where programmes are of this duration as a result of non-credit bearing placements this identifier will not appear.\nPlease consult the following for more information on each type of qualification:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\n2.1.2 Programme code\nPlease leave blank. A UCAS or Academic Plan code will be assigned by Registry and Academic Affairs (RAA) in UNUK, Academic Services Unit (ASU) in UNNC, and Student Registry Office (SRO) in UNM once a new programme has been approved.\n2.1.3 Administrating School\nIdentify the School responsible for overall management, administration, and quality assurance of the programme.\nIf operational responsibilities for any of these matters are delegated to other Schools, please state these schools, specify their role and the percentage of their contribution. Please also specify the campus and location for the programme.\n2.1.4 Partnership arrangement\nProvide information on any placement arrangements including details of the partner and whether the programme is based on an existing one.\nPlease consult the following for further guidance on partnerships and placements:\nPartnerships and placements\n2.1.5 Type of programme\nThe types of programme are defined as:\nSingle subject (with subject specific title)\nJoint (naming two distinct subjects as ‘x and y')\nMajor/Minor (naming two distinct subjects as ‘x with y' or similar)\nMultidisciplinary (listing three distinct subjects)\nPlease consult section 7 of the following for detailed definitions:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\n2.1.6 Mode of study\nChoose full time and/or part time.  For programmes offered in both full time and part time modes, a single programme specifications will be required.  The programme specification will encompass two separate descriptions of the programmes of study (part time and full time),  outlining the sequence in which modules are to be undertaken in each mode.\n2.1.7 Mode of delivery\nSpecify the mode(s) of delivery and location(s) (including University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) and University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC) where applicable) from the list below:\nFull-time\nPart-time\nDistance learning\nIn-Person\nBlended Learning\nUK campus\nUNM or UNNC or both\n2.1.8 Duration\nPlease confirm the duration of the programme (if available both full-time and part-time please provide the duration for both modes of delivery.\nBachelors: 3 years\nIntegrated Masters: 4 years\nPostgraduate Masters: 12 months full-time/24 months part-time\nPostgraduate 2 year Masters: 21 months full-time/22 months part-time\n2.1.9 Annual start date\nPlease indicate whether it follows a standard or non-standard start. If the programme begins on a date other than the start of the academic year, please provide the specific start date and all relevant start dates, where there is more than one date of commencement.\nStandard Start: Starts at the beginning of the academic year\nNon-Standard Start: Please state the start date(s) if the programme is to have start date which is anything other than the start of the academic year.  If there is more than one start date, please state all of them.\n2.1.10 Higher Education Classification of Subjects (HECoS) codes\nProvide the relevant HECoS code.\nPlease consult the following for more information about HECoS codes:\nHigher Education Classification of Subjects (HECoS) codes\n2.1.11 Accrediting body\nPlease state the following:\nThe name of any professional body which will, or is expected to, recognise or accredit the programme and the level along with type of that accreditation\nThe manner in which accreditation or recognition is necessary to practise a profession\nThe status of any application for accreditation or recognition and the timescale involved, including dates of professional body visits for accreditation or re-accreditation\n2.1.12 Relevant QAA subject benchmark(s) and characteristic statements\nPlease state the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) subject benchmarks which are most relevant to the programme. As there are few benchmarks for postgraduate study, it may not be possible to identify a relevant benchmark for postgraduate programmes – though it could still be helpful to list a benchmark for a corresponding undergraduate programme which would normally provide entry to the postgraduate programme.\nFor more information about lists of benchmarks, please consult the following:\nBenchmarks on the QAA website\nIn addition to the above, schools need to consider QAA characteristics statements published related to the proposed qualification to ensure that the distinctive features of the proposed qualification are articulated in module and programme specifications.\nFor information on Characteristics statements, please consult the following:\nCharacteristic statements on the QAA website\n2.1.13 Fees\nPlease state the fee band for home and international students.\n2.2 General information\nIf sections B, C, or D of the programme specification vary significantly based on the mode of delivery, consider submitting separate programme specifications for each version.\nProvide any information of interest to applicants including a programme outline and duration as a minimum.\n2.2.1 Educational aims\nSpecify educational aims particularly if not stated in the prospectus entry.\nInformation for students once they are at Nottingham – and not covered in Sections C, D, and E of the programme specification – must be included in the School’s own Student Handbook rather than being included in this section.\n2.2.2 Outline Description of the Programme\nPlease provide any information you think would be of interest to applicants for this programme. As a minimum, this must be an outline of the programme.\n2.2.3 How students will be taught\nPlease provide a programme level overview of how students will be taught, rather than specific details which may vary from year to year.  Prospective students will also see this information.\nAdditional information for students at Nottingham not covered in Sections C, D, and E of the programme specification must be included in the School’s Student Handbook rather than in this section.\n2.3 Supplementary regulations\nIf sections B, C, or D of the programme specification vary significantly based on the mode of delivery, consider submitting separate programme specifications for each version.\n2.3.1 Admission requirements\nPlease provide a summary of the minimum qualifications necessary to be considered for entry to the programme, including English language requirements, and any necessary skills or experience applicants must have. English Language requirements must be set at one of the five levels designated by the University, details of which are available from the Admissions Office.\nIf the programme is only available by internal transfer from another University of Nottingham programme and is therefore not open to external applicants, then this must also be indicated.\nInclude Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS), requirements, if applicable, and any other requirements.\nFor more information about the University's admission requirements, please consult the following:\nAdmissions\nAdmissions Office\n2.3.2 Programme structure\nAlign the programme structure to the University of Nottingham Qualifications Framework.\nPlease consult the following for more information:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\nFor each stage of the programme, please state:\nThe compulsory modules a student must take.\nWhere students are choosing modules from a list, how many modules they must choose and which modules are on the list. Each list must not contain active modules totalling over a maximum of 150 credits. Please note, programmes with extensive optionality may result in unavoidable clashes with less popular combinations of optional modules.\nWhether students have any unrestricted choices of modules.\nWhether students have any unrestricted choices of modules. If the programme includes modules from another School, consult with that school to ensure appropriateness, confirm requisites are amended to allow students to choose the modules and ensure sufficient capacity to accommodate additional students.\nModules must be assigned to one of three group types:\nCompulsory Group: all students on the programme must select all modules in this group.\nRestricted Group(s): students must select a minimum of XX credits and a maximum of XX credits from this group. Where multiple restricted groups are in use students choose from group one AND group two.\nAlternative Group(s): students must select a minimum of XX credits and a maximum of XX credits from this group. Where multiple alternative groups are in use students choose from group one OR group two.\nIn all cases:\nState the credit value, level of modules and semester in which they are being delivered.\nAll new programmes (and any programme changes) must be constituted by modules with  values of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 credits; with the majority being 20 credits or more. For the MRes only, larger credit sizes of 80, 100, 120, 140 or 160 are permitted. 10 credit modules must be in the minority. No more than 50% of credits in a stage, which includes the taught stage of a taught master’s programme, can be comprised of 10 credits.\nPlease note, there must be a maximum of 70 credits for UG programmes and 80 credits for PGT programmes in each semester.   For programmes offering full-year modules, the credits will be evenly divided between the Autumn and Spring for the purpose of calculating the maximum credits.\nDissertations will usually be set as  SUM (summer) offerings for PGT to avoid exceeding maximum credit split per semester.\nSpecify if modules are existing or new ones being submitted for approval.\nConsider the balance between directed and self-directed learning in the programme as a whole and adhere to the University policy on minimum expectations for levels of teaching and learning activity.\nPlease consult the following for more information about the University's minimum expectations for levels of teaching and learning activity:\nMinimum expectations for levels of teaching and learning activity\nPlease consult the following for more information on semester dates relating to the general teaching and examination periods at the University:\nUniversity calendar dates\n2.3.3 Non-compensatable modules\nPlease indicate for each module whether it can be compensated (Compensatable with a Y) or not (Non-compensatable with an N) under University’s regulations for the compensation of fail marks.\nPlease consult the following for more information about the University's assessment and marking policies:\nAssessment and marking policies\nPlease be aware of the following:\nA non-compensatable module is one which must to be passed at the relevant level (40% for honours degrees, 50% for masters' degrees, PG Certificates and PG Diplomas).  A student has the opportunity to resit the module for progression purposes (except in their final year of undergraduate study), but they must achieve over the minimum level in one of their attempts to be awarded the credits for that module.\nIn contrast, compensatable modules allow a failed mark to be compensated by better performance in other modules provided the student meets the requirements set out in the relevant study regulations. For example, a poor performance of 35% in a compensatable module may be balanced out by a good performance of 60% in another module.\n2.3.4 Additional components\nWhere programmes allow for students to have a free choice for a module, please ensure that additional groups are added.  For additional groups, please specify how many credits (or range of credits) students must take from that group.  Please also specify the timing of these additional components within the programme.\nFor more information, please consult the following QM page:\nAcademic regulations\n2.3.5 Assessment\nThe programme must adhere to the University's Undergraduate and Postgraduate taught assessment regulations.\nAll teaching and assessment must be in English, except where the subject of study is a language or literature other than English.\nPlease consult the following for more information:\nAcademic regulations\n2.3.5 Progression information:\n2.3.5.1 Undergraduate\nStandard University progression regulations will apply except in the following circumstances: integrated masters' programmes; honours degrees with a compulsory year out; and between a foundation year and qualifying year. In these cases, non-standard progression regulations can apply if clearly stated in the programme specification.\nFor integrated masters' programmes, where applied, the single allowable enhanced progression requirement is that a student must achieve a weighted average mark of at least 55% at the first attempt.\nRegulation 20 states that a student can proceed carrying up to 20 credits if they have not progressed by September. Programme specifications may state an opt-out if it is impossible or unwise for a student to proceed carrying credits. Possible circumstances where an exception may be permitted include:\n2+2 programme students coming from University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) and University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC) – where the Home Office would not issue a visa unless the student has progressed\nProgrammes that could not cope with the additional resource or facilities implications of additional students – for example, those with placements\nCases where it is essential for a student to have passed (as opposed to have taken) a pre-requisite module before starting the next part of their programme.\nProgression from a foundation programme to an honours degree\nAny requests for exemption must be approved by Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) and noted in the programme specification.\n2.3.5.2 Postgraduate\nWhere schools require students to pass or to perform at a particular minimum level in the taught stage of a programme before progressing to the research stage (that is, the dissertation or research project) this will be explicitly stated in the programme specification.\n2.3.6 Degree information:\n2.3.6.1 Undergraduate\nThe standardised weighting for a bachelor’s degree must be 33/67 for Parts I and II respectively, and that the standardised weighting for an integrated master’s degree (undergraduate) must be 20/40/40 for Parts I, II and III respectively, unless exempted from this due to professional, statutory, regulatory body (PSRB)requirements.\nUndergraduate degree classification is based on the weighted (arithmetic) mean mark achieved over identified stages (with defined weightings given to the stages being considered).\nIf the award of an ordinary degree is available to students not meeting honours requirements this must be stated clearly in the programme specification and an ordinary degree programme specification must be held on Campus Solutions.\nFor more information about UG classification, compensation and borderline regulations, please consult the following:\nMarking and classification\nPlease note that from 2015/2016 transfer to the ordinary degree is not allowed. The award of the ordinary degree on exit is only allowed at the UK campus and University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC).\n2.3.6.2 Postgraduate\nPostgraduate masters, diploma and certificates will be awarded with merit to students who achieve a final credit-weighted mark of at least 60% and with distinction to students who achieve a final credit-weighted mark of at least 70%.\nIn addition, please note the following:\nIn accordance with the regulations on marking and grading, viva voce examinations must not be used to decide whether or not a borderline candidate will have their degree class raised.\nFor more information about PGT classification, compensation and borderline regulations, please consult the following:\nPGT Academic Regulations\n2.3.7 Pathways\nPlease provide here details of any additional awards made by the University, e.g. ‘Distinction in Spoken French’ and/or any named Pathways* that may be awarded.\n*pathways are for the purpose of the award title, not for managing programme structures or enrolments and allow for a ‘specialism’ to be added to the title on the degree, and thus where the inclusion of a Pathway(s) has been approved, the School is then responsible for updating the programme specification of the existing programme to state what criteria would need to be met to have specialism added.  The award title will take the format: Subject (Pathway) for example BSc Hons Animal Science (Physiology).\nPlease note that pathways would NOT result in being able to recruit programmes individually by specialism i.e. applications must be to the main title.\n2.3.8 Fall back options\nPlease state here the title of the award which may be given to students who fail to meet the requirements of this degree.  Where the title differs from that of the main award specific approval will be required.\nRegulations may deviate from standard if there is a demonstrable requirement dictated by a PSRB or accrediting body. Any such requirement must be explicitly outlined in the programme specification. Students failing to satisfy the more stringent requirements outlined in programme specifications associated with a PSRB or accrediting body, yet satisfying University regulations must have the option to transfer to a named ‘fall back’ non-accredited degree.\nExceptions to this rule arise only where PSRB or local government mandates prevent the award of a ‘fallback’ degree or when a suitable ‘fallback’ option is unavailable. In such instances, this information must be clearly articulated in the programme specification.\nWhere a fallback award (Foundation Certificate, UG Certificate, UG Diploma, PG Certificate, PG Diploma) has a different title than the original programme this must be explicitly stated in the programme specification.  For example, the title may differ due to lack of accreditation, or it may not be appropriate to award the title to someone of lower credit value awards.\n2.3.9 Other regulations\nSpecify any other requirements for students which are in addition to those stated in the University’s regulations and the University of Nottingham Qualifications Framework (UNQF).\nIf the programme's total absolute maximum is less than those defined on the Maximum period from initial registration for completion of studies page, this must be explicitly stated. For more information, please consult the following:\nRegistration, attendance and study\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\nMaximum period from initial registration for the completion of studies\n2.4 Learning outcomes\nIf sections B, C, or D of the programme specification vary significantly based on the mode of delivery, consider submitting separate programme specifications for each version.\n2.4.1 Definition\nLearning outcomes are (relatively) general statements indicating what a student is expected to know, understand and/or be able to demonstrate at the end of a period of learning. They are phrases which complete a sentence of the form \"A student who completes this programme successfully would be expected to …\", or \"… would be able to …\".\nIt is good practice for learning outcomes to comprise a verb, object and context. An example (from Human Development) would be \"Critically examine (verb) theoretical frameworks (object) relevant to neonatal development and adaption (context)\". All three parts are needed to make the learning outcome workable.\nLearning outcomes play a crucial role in the design of programmes and modules, establishing a clear connection with the content and objectives. The purpose of assessment is to enable students the opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which they have achieved the intended learning outcomes.\nProgramme learning outcomes must align with the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) Subject Benchmark Statement, the level descriptors in the University of Nottingham Qualifications Framework (UNQF) and any professional or statutory body requirements. Please consult the following for more information:\nBenchmarks on the QAA site\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\nA curriculum map, provided as part of the programme approval (or curriculum change) process, will demonstrate how module learning outcomes fulfil to the learning outcomes of the programme.\n2.4.2 Categories of learning outcomes\nIt is reasonable to have up to six learning outcomes for a module, with some variability depending on the credit value of the modules (typically with less learning outcomes for smaller credit sizes), and between 12 and 16 for a programme. Some cases, may warrant additional learning outcomes, for example due to PSRB requirements etc\nModule learning outcomes may be specific to the module, the programme, or a combination of module and programme learning outcomes.\nIt is advisable to minimise the reoccurrence of the same learning outcome across multiple modules. This minimises the number of learning outcomes in each module and avoids assessing the same learning outcomes multiple times.\nLevels of assessment required to meet learning outcomes will be checked through the approval of the curriculum map.\nFor further information please see module specification guidance:\nModule Specification Guidance\nLearning outcomes for both programmes and modules should be written under one or both of the following two categories (other categorisations may be used where there are PSRB requirements):\n1.   Knowledge and understanding\nThese are outcomes which broadly describe the subject matter of the programme or module.\n2.   Skills\nThese are outcomes which can come under one or more of the following three sub-headings:\nIntellectual skills – the abilities required to process the subject matter\nProfessional or practical skills – those skills specific to a particular subject area, such as laboratory or field work, or the requirements of a specific professional or regulatory body\nTransferable or key skills – more specific skills which will commonly comprise most of the following:\nOral and written communication\nTeam work\nSelf management\nProblem solving\nCritical thinking\nProfessionalism\nInformation technology literacy\nNumeracy\n2.4.3 Assessing and attaining learning outcomes within modules\nTo achieve a learning outcome within a module, it is expected that a student at a minimum, has had the opportunity to acquire the necessary knowledge and develop the required skills, ultimately passing the module.\n2.4.4 Attaining learning outcomes within programmes\nThe learning outcomes listed for a programme are expected to accurately reflect the modules on which a student can expect to enrol as part of that programme.\nIn some instances, meeting all the learning outcomes specified for a programme may be mandatory for example, due to Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Bodies (PSRB) requirements.\nProvide a brief summary of the teaching, learning and assessment methods used to enable these learning outcomes to be achieved and demonstrated. For example:\nTeaching and learning*: Lectures; tutor-led tutorials; student and tutor led seminars; on-line tutorials; problem-based learning scenarios.\nAssessment: coursework*: written seen or unseen examinations; poster presentation.\nThese statements are expected to demonstrate how the programme has been structured to enable students to achieve the intended learning outcomes in terms of workload, volume and nature of assessment, programme progression and increasing intellectual demand.  They are expected to be general, not specific, in nature.\n2.5 Curriculum map\nPlease map the learning outcomes of the programme against the modules comprising the programme.\nThe curriculum map must show that a student cannot successfully complete the programme without having acquired all the learning outcomes listed in Section D of the programme specification. This can be demonstrated by ensuring that for each learning outcome there is at least one compulsory, non-compensatable module which delivers that outcome; or that the outcome features in a range of modules, such that it would not be possible for the student to complete the programme without passing at least one of those modules.\nNew/revised curriculum maps are required with all new and changed programme specification.\nA template for a curriculum map can be found here:\nCurriculum map\nThis template curriculum map is provided as a guide.  Where there are PSRB requirements for a different format, this may be used.\n2.6 Delivery plan\nPlease provide a full plan mapping out the timelines for the programme.\n3.0 Related regulations, policies and procedures\nFor more information about the information in a programme specification document, please consult the following:\nProgramme specification template\nFor more information about the information in a module specification docuemtn, please consult the following:\nModule specification guidance\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to Programme specification guidance, please email:\nss-curriculumadvice@nottingham.ac.uk\n4.0 Version control table\nVersion control table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nClarifications made as part of a review of this section of the Quality Manual.  Also reformatted to align with new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework\nQSC\nAugust 2024\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to Programme specification guidance, please email:\nss-curriculumadvice@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n20 September 2024||"

Its content is only applicable across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Overview\nThese regulations take effect from 2015/16 for students entering Qualifying year or Part I from September 2015. Students entering Qualifying year or Part I before September 2015 are subject to the former regulations.\nFor more information about the former regulations, please consult the following:\nUndergraduate study regulations\n1. Introduction\nIt may be possible for students who fail to meet requirements for an Honours degree to be awarded either an Ordinary degree or Pass degree if they meet the requirements for these qualifications.\n2. Honours students failing at the end of Part II\nIncludes:\nUniversity of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM)\nWhere a student is unable to receive a classified Honours degree at the end of Part II, that student should be considered for a Pass in that degree (which will be awarded without Honours) either before or after reassessment (see Regulation 22 of the Undergraduate Regulations).\nStudents who successfully complete an Honours degree after reassessment may receive a Pass degree without an Honours classification. For a Pass degree to be awarded a candidate must have a weighted final average of at least 40%, which can include reassessment marks from Parts I/II/III.\nA student who is unable to qualify for a Pass may be transferred to an Ordinary degree programme (where a suitable one exists) and awarded an Ordinary degree if that student satisfies the requirement for an award as set out in the programme specification for that Ordinary degree.\n* University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM)\nNote however that owing to the requirements of the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA) this option is not available at University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) from the 2014/15 academic session.\nA student failing to satisfy the requirements of an Ordinary degree after one reassessment opportunity, should be considered for a lower award as outlined in the University of Nottingham Qualifications Framework (UNQF). Note however that owing to the requirements of the MQA this option is not available at UNM.\nMore information\nFor more information about Degree classifications or the University's Qualifications Framework, please consult the following:\nDegree classification\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\n3. Structure of Ordinary Degree Programmes\nThe required structure of Ordinary degree programmes is set out in the University's Qualifications Framework (UNQF). There is no Qualifying Stage to these programmes, as entry is only possible via transfer from an Honours degree programme at the end of Part II. In summary, the structure of Ordinary degree programmes is 100 credits at both Parts I and II (with at least 60 credits at level 3).\nMore information on the University Qualifications Framework can be found here:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\n4. Programme Specifications for Ordinary Degrees\nA separate programme specification is required for each Ordinary degree programme which a School chooses to award. Material may be copied from a cognate Honours degree programme specification, but a separate document needs to exist for the Ordinary degree programme. Where a programme specification does not exist for an Ordinary degree currently being offered, this should be rectified as soon as possible and certainly no later than the date of the School's next periodic School Review.\nSchools are asked to note the following when drawing up programme specifications for Ordinary degrees:\nThere is no requirement or encouragement for Schools to offer Ordinary degree programmes\nWhere there is a pattern of students failing non-compensatable components of Honours degree programmes, but performing generally at Honours level, it is more appropriate to establish an alternative (perhaps non-accredited) Honours programme (see Regulation 28 of the Undergraduate regulations). For more information, please consult the following:\nUndergraduate study regulations\nIt may be more efficient to create a single Ordinary degree programme for an entire subject or School to which students from a variety of Honours programmes can be transferred, but the student must be able to meet all the learning outcomes of any Ordinary degree programme to which they are transferred and the degree title should be a reasonable reflection of the subject.\n5. Transfers from Honours to Ordinary\nIncludes:\nstudents whose programmes began before September 2004\nTransfer to an Ordinary degree from Honours is not permitted as the Ordinary degree is only available, where offered, as an exit award for students failing at the end of Part II.\nStudents whose programmes began before September 2004 will be dealt with under the former First Degree Regulations and may receive an Ordinary degree under the provisions of those Regulations.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nRegulations for first degrees before September 2005\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please email:\nug-regulations@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n29 June 2020||"

For students commencing their programmes before this date, the Master of Research Regulations (pre-September 2019) will apply.\nFor more information about the previous regulations, please consult the following:\nRegulations for the Degree of Master of Research (MRes) before September 2019\nStudents from countries that are not familiar with the MRes qualification may, alternatively, be awarded a MA or MSc by Research in order not to disadvantage those students. The regulations for these awards will, though, be exactly the same as for the MRes. This will also be permitted, with QSC approval, where required by professional, regulatory or accrediting bodies.\nAdmissions requirement\n1.\nRequirements for admission to a research degree are set out in the Academic entry requirements page, which can be found here:\nAcademic entry requirements\nProgramme of study\n2.\nStudents will be admitted to a one year, full-time (two years, part-time) programme of study.\nTaught and thesis elements\n3.\nStudents are required to study modules worth 180 credits, of which 60 credits must be obtained from taught modules at Level 4 and from the Research Training Programme run by the Graduate School or other units offering generic training within the University, or from within any other generic training courses run within individual Schools. The remaining 120 credits must be obtained from a thesis module at Level 4. Any taught modules and research training taken must be clearly cognate with the student’s research topic.  Supervision while undertaking the thesis module will be as set out in the module specification and in line with the requirements for supervision contained in the regulations for research degrees.\n4.\nIn cases where 60 credits of modules of the requisite level and subject matter are not available, supplementary regulations may stipulate a smaller number of taught/training credits and a thesis module of more than 120 credits (such that the overall number of credits remains at 180). In these circumstances, the maximum word length of the thesis may be greater than that stated in Regulation 6 (in the Assessment section) below and the compensation arrangements stated in Regulation 10 (in the Outcomes of examination section) below will not apply.\nTransfer to PhD\n5.\nA candidate shall not be permitted to count the same period of research for both the degree of Master of Research (MRes) and the degree of PhD. However a candidate for the MRes degree may, after a period of not less than nine months study for the MRes and prior to the submission of the thesis, with the approval of the supervisor and Head of School (or equivalent), submit an application to the University for permission to be registered as a candidate for the degree of PhD instead of a Master of Research. The period of registration for the degree of PhD should normally be three years (and not less than two years) full-time from the initial date of registration for the MRes.\nAssessment\nIncludes:\nmodule specifications; submitting thesis before end of registered study; viva voce examinations\n6.\nThe assessment of all modules is as set out in the specifications for those modules. In regard to the thesis module, the maximum word length of the thesis is 25,000 words. The maximum word limit is inclusive of appendices, footnotes, tables and bibliography. The Thesis should embody the result of the candidate’s advanced study and research.\nFrom September 2020 all students are subject to Regulation 6 from the September 2020 regulations, which can be found here:\nRegulations for the Degree of Master of Research (MRes) from September 2020\n7.\nStudents are required to submit their thesis prior to the end of the period of registered study. Two copies of the thesis should be submitted to Student Services or equivalent (in a form prescribed by the University), who will forward the thesis to the Examiners. The thesis should not, whether in the same or a different form, have been submitted to this or any other University for the award of any degree.\n8.\nThe thesis must be the result of the student’s own work. The requirement does not preclude a student obtaining limited assistance with proof-reading and with the routine collection and/or processing of data under guidelines and instructions clearly devised by the student. When such help is obtained it should be with the prior approval of the supervisor who must be satisfied that the spirit of the 'own work' requirement is not breached.\n9.\nThe thesis is examined by both an External Examiner and an Internal Examiner appointed under the regulations governing the assessment of research degrees, who should provide independent reports on the thesis, indicating whether the thesis module has been passed; and also whether a viva voce examination is necessary. Where a viva voce examination is required by the examiners, this should be conducted in line with the relevant regulations for MPhil degrees.\nFor more information about the Viva voce examinations, please consult the following:\nViva voce examinations\nOutcomes of examination\nIncludes:\naward of degree; where a student obtains a fail mark or failed thesis or training credits; nottingham etheses service\n10.\nThe degree is awarded where all taught modules and training credits and the thesis module have been passed. The pass mark for all taught modules is 50%, but marks of 40%-49% can be compensated in up to 20 credits if the overall average for the taught modules taken is 50% or over. Training credits will be assessed on a pass/fail basis.\n11.\nWhere a student obtains a fail mark in a taught module that is not compensated, or fails the thesis module or training credits, the student has one further opportunity to pass those modules. All reassessments must be completed within one year of the end of the student's period of registered study.\n12.\nThe qualification awarded to the student will include the subject of study undertaken as notified to the student at the time of admission.\n13.\nSuccessful candidates will be eligible to graduate once their thesis has been uploaded to the University’s eTheses service and approved by the Internal Examiner or, in cases where there are two external examiners, the lead External Examiner. For more information, please consult the following:\nNottingham eTheses\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n23 October 2024||"

It content is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.1. Timing of viva voce examination\nThe Head of School has overall responsibility for ensuring that viva voce examinations normally take place within\n3 months\nof the submission of the thesis to Student Services, the Student Registry Office at UNM or  the Graduate School at UNNC, and that the appropriate Office is informed of the dates of viva voce examinations.\n2. Location for viva voce examination\nThe viva voce examination (if required, as will be the case for doctoral degrees) will normally take place at the University.\nHowever, the Head of School may give permission in appropriate circumstances for the viva voce examination to be held in another location or through online means provided agreement of the Examiners and the student is obtained and the proposed location/format is one that is deemed by them all to be suitable for the purpose.\nThese decisions will be indicated on the Nomination of Examiners form, which will alert Registry and Academic Affairs to the proposed arrangements.\nGuidance and recommendations on the conduct of a digital/online viva voce examination\n3. Format\nIf circumstances demand it, a viva voce examination may be organised in another form (e.g. by a video conference/other online platform).\nBefore agreeing such an arrangement the School must check that appropriate facilities for an online viva voce are available to all participants, and shall ensure they have written confirmation that the student and the Examiners have agreed to the proposal. Hybrid viva conditions with only the candidate located remotely are not permitted. If a hybrid viva is unavoidable, if and where possible, the candidate should be co-located with either the Internal Examiner or Independent Chair.\nIf an online viva voce format is agreed by all parties, this cannot subsequently be used as grounds for an appeal. Recording of the viva is not permitted, and no evidence based on unauthorised recordings of the viva will be permissible in any appeal process.\n4. Appointment of the Chair\nIf Schools wish to do so, an independent, non-examining Chair may be appointed to preside over the viva proceedings in order to ensure consistency between different vivas and to provide an additional viewpoint if the conduct of the viva should become the subject of a student appeal.\nWhere the appointment of an independent Chair is not feasible, Schools should find alternative ways of assuring fairness and consistency which are acceptable to the student.\nWhere vivas are being conducted by online methods where all parties are at different locations, an independent non-examining Chair must be appointed. Other circumstances when an Independent Chair must be appointed are detailed in additional guidance.\nCircumstances under which an independent Chair should be appointed\nWhen appointed or required for an online viva, the independent Chair will chair the viva and be present throughout but not take an active role in the examination or decision making.\nAppointment, role and responsibilities of the independent Chair\n5. Attendance at proceedings\nSupervisors may not normally attend the viva voce examination. If concerns about process or PGR support or performance are raised, an independent Chair should attend to ensure fairness and consistency of examination process.\nThe Head of School has a right to attend as an observer at the viva voce examination of any research student in their School, unless they are the student's supervisor, in which case a deputy should be appointed to attend in their place (see paragraph 13 of the Role and Appointment of Examiners for the right to attend as a supervisor). For more information, please consult the following:\nRole and Appointment of Examiners\nBefore the viva voce examination takes place the Head of School should first inform the Examiners, the student and the supervisor that they intend to attend. The Examiners may request that the Head of School attend a viva voce examination.\nIf the viva voce is held online, the candidate may request that they have a supporter/observer present with them either for the entire viva, and/or for the communication of the decision. This individual must not contribute in any way to the viva, and must be introduced to all participants on camera at the start.\n6. Purpose of viva\nThe viva will include questions and discussions that determine whether the candidate has achieved the required doctoral outcomes.\nFor more information about the UNQF, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\nThis will normally include questions and discussion designed to: ascertain that the thesis embodies the candidate’s own research; clarify aspects of the research presented in the thesis to ensure understanding; test the candidate’s general comprehension of the field of study within which the subject of the thesis falls; test the candidate’s acquaintance with the general literature of the subject and knowledge of the relationship of the work to the wider field of which it is a part; and determine the respects in which the work advances, modifies, or otherwise affects this wider field of scholarship.\n7. Completion of Joint Report Form\nFollowing the viva voce examination the Examiners will complete and sign the Joint Report Form and shall come to agreement on the recommendation on the award (or not) of the degree.\nThe option not to award any degree following the first examination is one which should only be chosen in extreme circumstances.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nGraduate School - PGR\nGS-PGR@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n22 October 2024||"

        "content": "Programme design, development and approval - The University of NottinghamProgramme design, development and approval\nThis page contains instructions for the approval of new programmes of study, including approval of new programmes by change. Its content is primarily directed at staff, and may also be of interest to students, across the UK, China and Malaysia campuses1. Purpose\nThis page contains instructions for the approval of new programmes of study to be offered by the University on all campuses. This includes approval for new mico-credential programmes offered by UoNO.\nThe purpose of the approval process is to ensure that appropriate academic standards are set and maintained, and that programmes offered to students make available learning opportunities which enable the intended learning outcomes to be achieved.\n2.0 Key principles\nTo meet the responsibility for academic standards and quality of learning opportunities, please consult the UK Quality code for HE advice and guidance, QAA Characteristics statements and QAA Subject benchmark statements (see links below). The University regulations on minimum expectations relating to teaching and learning must also be consulted.\n2.1 Free speech\nWhen developing a new programme, appropriate regard must be given to the importance of promoting free speech.\nPlease consult the following for further information about the Freedom of Speech Act:\nFree Speech and Academic Freedom at the University of Nottingham\nOffice for Students guidance on free speech.\n2.2 Academic freedom\nIn relation to programme and module development, approval, and delivery, it should be noted that academics would not be prohibited from developing or delivering a programme or module on the ground that it involves giving serious consideration to ‘controversial or unpopular opinions’. This is not a reason that the programme would be approved, rather it is not a reason it could be declined. For instance, there will remain business or logistical reasons to not grant approval to a programme or module.\n2.3 Timeline for approval and CMA considerations (UNUK Only)\nTo meet the university’s UKs publishing deadlines for the undergraduate and postgraduate prospectus, and to achieve a full cycle of marketing, Schools must aim for their programme to be developed and approved at least 5 weeks ahead of the publishing deadlines in the table below.\nUK Prospectus publishing dates for UG and PGT programmes\nUndergraduate\n1 March in the calendar year before students commence the course (e.g. 1 March 2025 for 26/27 entry with changes to prospectus information being completed by 1 December 2024)\nPostgraduate Taught\n1 July in the calendar year before students commence the course (e.g. 1 July 2025 for 26/27 entry with changes to prospectus information being completed by 1 April 2025)\nThere may be occasions when Schools request the introduction of a new programme after the release of the online prospectus. Each request will be carefully considered by RAA, Marketing, Admissions, the Legal team and other key individuals in the University as appropriate. For new programmes, the main consideration would be whether there would be a viable cohort of students recruited without a full marketing and recruitment cycle. In these circumstances the Faculty Pro Vice Chancellor (FPVC) or FPVC nominee will be presented with information about potential recruitment or CMA risks and asked to decide whether to proceed as planned or delay, weighing up the benefits against the outlined potential risks.\n2.4 Latest dates for programme approval (all campuses)\nThe latest possible dates for programme approval are detailed in the table below.\nColleagues should consider building in time contingences to their development timelines to allow for possible delays, for example if the Programme Review Panel ask for major revisions to be submitted to the next panel or if the stakeholder consultation surfaces issues which need time to be resolved. It is recommended that colleagues aim for one or two panels earlier than the latest possible dates to ensure programmes are approved in time for planned start dates.\nLatest dates for obtaining university approval for new programmes\nRequire UCAS recruitment\nRequire timetabling\nLatest date for university approval\nYes\nYes\n1 March in the calendar year before students commence the course\nNo\nYes\n31 January in the same calendar year students commence the course\nNo\nNo\n31 July in the same calendar year students commence the course\nFor further advice and guidance about timelines for submission and approval, please email:\nss-curriculumadvice@nottingham.ac.uk\n3.0 Roles and responsibilities\nEndorsement from the School and Faculty must be sought prior to developing a new programme of study. Then, the School are responsible for completing the programme outline form and for preparing the appropriate business case (see below). This includes liaison with stakeholders e.g. affected Schools, employers, students and external advice as appropriate.\nRAA colleagues will review the programme outline form and later the appropriate business case (or form) and liaise with necessary University colleagues.\n4.0 Procedural steps\nThe process set out i below should be read in conjunction with the programme approval process flow charts for each campus, which can be accessed here:\nProgramme approval process flow chart (UNUK)\nProgramme approval process flow chart (UNM)\nProgramme approval process flow chart (UNNC)\nPlease note, colleagues in UNM and UNNC complete each of the required steps for new programme approval but vary the order of completion due to local campus structures. These are reflected in the flow charts.\n4.1.   School and Faculty endorsement\nEndorsement from the School and Faculty must be sought prior to developing a new programme of study. In the UK, endorsement at School level must come from the Head of School, Head of School nominee or School Committee, and endorsement at Faculty level must come from the Faculty Pro Vice Chancellor (FPVC), FPVC nominee or Faculty level committee (e.g. Faculty Education and Student Experience Committee). In UNM endorsement must come from Head of School or Faculty Teaching and Learning Committee. In UNNC endorsement at School level must come from the School Meeting and endorsement at Faculty level must come from Faculty Executive Board.\nConsideration should be given at this stage as to whether the new programme contributes to School, Faculty and University level strategic priorities.\nThere may be local variations for seeking endorsement depending on Campus and/or School structures; however, at the end of this stage there must be clear support from both the School and the Faculty to proceed to the next stage.\nEndorsement can be recorded via email or noted in committee minutes. Colleagues are advised to keep evidence of this for future audit purposes.\n4.2   Completion of programme outline form\nOnce endorsement from School and Faculty has been obtained, Schools must complete the Programme Outline form (link below) to provide a brief overview of the proposed new programme to ensure that relevant university colleagues are aware of developments.\nNew Programme Outline Form\n4.3 University review of the new programme request\nThe data collected via the MS Forms will be reviewed by Registry and Academic Affairs (RAA) and shared with other internal stakeholders, as appropriate, for business planning purposes. Stakeholders include, but are not limited to:\nAdmissions\nMarketing\nFaculty Curriculum Design Managers (if applicable)\nTeams within Registry and Academic Affairs\nOther teams as appropriate to the programme of study or campus\nProfessional and Workbased Learning Team (if relevant)\nThe purpose of providing information this stage is to understand the number of new or revised programmes in development to prepare for business partnering and business planning. RAA will only follow up on submissions if content appears to deviate from regulations, has unusual delivery aspirations which may present problems operationally (i.e. compatibility with systems), or may present Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) regulation challenges. If there are any issues or questions, RAA will notify School colleagues promptly.  Queries at this stage need not hold up development of the business case (if applicable), but issues identified by RAA must be considered and resolved as early as possible in the development stage to save time later.\n4.4.   Development and approval of business case\nBusiness case template to use:  The School is required to develop a full business case for most new taught programmes of study using the following templates:\nFull business case for a new programme of study template (UNUK)\nFull business case for a new programme of study template (UNNC)\nFull business case for a new programme of study template (UNM)\nFor new apprenticeship programmes, contact the Institute for Professional and Workbased Learning Team for support with business case development.\nIn the following scenarios in UNUK and UNNC only, a full business case is not required and an addendum business case or an alternative form must be used instead of the full business case template. Please note, a full business case is required for all new programmes which will be delivered at UNM.\nAlternative forms are received and approved by the Curriculum Approvals and Advisory Team on behalf of QSC. See 4.5 for more information about approval of business cases and business case addendum.\nAlternative forms where full business case is not required scenarios\nScenarios\nForm\nIntroduce a new programme which is based on an existing programme of study (Mirror Programme offered on another campus)\nBusiness case addendum\nIntroduce a higher award where a lower award already exists\nBusiness case addendum\nIntroduce a placement or industrial year to an existing programme\nMS Form\nIntroduce a new programme with no qualification\nMS Form\nIntroduce a new PG Cert or PG Dip where a Masters programme already exists\nMS Form\nIntroduce a new research degree\nMS Form\nIntroduce a fall-back award (for exit awards only)\nMS Form\nIntroduce a pathway(s) to an existing programme\nMS Form\nPlease note colleagues in UNM require a full business case for all new programmes.\nFor further advice and guidance about development of the business case or relevant forms, please contact -\nss-curriculumadvice@nottingham.ac.uk\n4.4.1 Consultation about the business case\nSchools are expected to proactively engage with internal and external stakeholders, including students, alumni and employers, for appropriate advice and guidance in developing their full or addendum business case. The details of this engagement with stakeholders must be recorded in the appropriate section of the full or addendum business case document.\nAn up-to-date list of internal contacts is available to assist with this process, which can be accessed here:\nInternal contacts for business case support (UNUK)\nInternal contacts for business case support (UNNC)\nInternal contacts for business case support (UNM)\nOther sources of appropriate advice might include:\nInternal academic staff from related subject areas\nContacts made through partnerships with other educational institutions, industry, professional practice or through research collaborations\nContacts from academic subject associations and Advanced HE\nEmployers, for example, through industrial advisory boards\nOrganisations in communities with which the programme may be involved.\nKey stakeholders, as identified in the full business case template, must complete the recommendation section, reporting any areas of concern which need addressing. Recommendation options for key stakeholders are:\n1 – Support\n2 – Support with amendments\n3 – Do not support\n4.4.2 External advice for the business case\nExternal experts, including relevant Professional, Regulatory and Statutory Bodies (PSRBs), employers and other external stakeholders, contribute to course design and review. Schools are expected to seek appropriate external advice for all new programme submissions which require a full business case.  The external advice form must be submitted with the business case.\nThe external advice form can be accessed here:\nExternal advice for a new programme of study form\n4.5. Approval of full or addendum business case\nIt is expected that full consideration will be given to business viability, recommendations and feedback from stakeholders and external advice on the business case. Business cases will not proceed further in the process without appropriate sign off.\nBusiness cases may be held at this stage until the relevant authority is satisfied (i.e. if revisions, further development, evidence, or consultation is needed) or be rejected.\n4.5.1 UK Campuses\nWhen the full or addendum business case is completed (as applicable), the School must fill out the Submission of Business Case form and attach the full or addendum business case  to it. The external advice form must also be submitted along with any full business case.\nThe Submission of business case form can be found here:\nSubmission of a business case (UNUK) - MS Form\nThe submitted form will be automatically routed to the Faculty Pro Vice Chancellor (FPVC) or FPVC nominee for consideration and sign off.  The paperwork then gets sent to RAA for the next step in the process.\nUK Apprenticeship programmes require further approval from the Pro-Vice Chancellor for Education and Student Experience and the Academic Director of Degree Apprenticeships.\n4.5.2 UNM / UNNC Campuses\nIn UNNC, when the full or addendum business case is completed (as applicable), the School must send the business case (with accompanying external advice form for full business cases) to the Planning and Resources Committee for non-curriculum sections approval and then for approval  by the Education and Student Experience Committee.\nIn UNM, when the full or addendum business case is completed (as applicable), the School must send the business case (with accompanying external advice form for full business cases) to  the Campus Teaching and Learning Committee, Planning and Resources Committee and the Global Engagement Committee (if applicable).\nOnce the business cases are approved as above, then the approved business cases and accompanying external advice forms (as appliable) must be emailed to\nss-curriculumadvice@nottingham.ac.uk\nfor the next step in the process.\n4.6. Development of curriculum documentation\nThe next step in the process is for the School to prepare the curriculum documentation, i.e. the programme specification, the module specification and the curriculum map, plus any partnership agreements (if required).\nUpon receipt of the approved full or addendum business case, RAA will assign a Business Partner to work with the School to assist in the development of their curriculum documentation (programme specification, module specifications and curriculum map).\nThe partnering process will ensure Schools receive appropriate and useful advice about University regulations and operability of programmes of study in any systems. RAA will seek advice from relevant professional services colleagues on any areas which might need specialist input.\nIf the new programme also requires a partnership agreement, Schools must submit curriculum documentation with the partnership agreement to the Partnership Operational Development Meeting (POD) so they can be considered together.\nThe Business Partner from RAA will confirm with the School when they are satisfied that all the curriculum documentation is completed, and any concerns about operability or adherence with Quality Manual regulations have been addressed.  At this point, the application will proceed to the next stage.\n4.7. Consultation on curriculum documentation\nRAA will make available the curriculum documentation (programme specification, module specifications, curriculum map, partnership agreement), external advice and full/addendum business case (as applicable) to a wide range of internal stakeholders across the University, including Schools, Faculties and Professional Services Departments, for a two-week period for scrutiny. This is the final opportunity for stakeholder queries to be raised.\nDuring this process the stakeholders may send comments/queries for the School to address.\nThe School must respond to the comments/queries raised by stakeholders during this consultation process in a timely manner and address them to the stakeholder’s satisfaction.  Otherwise this may lead to delays in approval.\nAny unresolved issues raised during this consultation period will be referred to a Programme Review Panel for consideration and approval (see below).\n4.8. New Programme approval – no outstanding issues\nProgrammes of study which have full stakeholder support for the full/addendum business case (if applicable), no unresolved issues from the consultation with stakeholders, and do not present any challenging operational or regulatory issues, will be approved by the Associate Director (Curriculum & Timetabling) or the Senior Manager (Head of Curriculum) on behalf of Quality and Standards Committee (QSC).\n4.9 New Programme Approval - at a Programme Review Panel\nAll other programmes will be put forward for consideration at the next available Programme Review Panel for approval. Representatives from the School must attend the Programme Review Panel to respond to questions.\nPanel dates are published prior to the start of the academic year, with around six meetings scheduled in each academic year. The ‘next available date’ will take into consideration time for the Programme Review Panel to consider the documentation in advance.  As a general guide, papers for the previous step need to be submitted to RAA at least one month prior to the Programme Review Panel to allow time to complete the two-week Stakeholder Consultation (see previous step) and for the Programme Review Panel to consider the documentation in advance.\nThe Programme Review Panel at a minimum will consist of two QSC members, one of which will take the role of Chair, and senior representation from the RAA: normally the Senior Manager (Head of Curriculum) or delegate. The academic lead(s) for the programme of study being considered will be expected to attend the panel and answer any queries put to them. Other colleagues may be invited to attend the panel if they have noted issues on the business case or during the consultation that are yet to be resolved.\nIn considering the curriculum documentation, the Programme Review Panel will:\nMake a judgement on any issues that fall outside the current scope of the Quality Manual.\nReview the operability of the proposed new programme, considering stakeholder feedback in relation to this.\nConsider the key academic aspects of programme specification – that is, the learning outcomes and how they will be taught and assessed. This consideration will be largely limited to ensuring that the learning outcomes are appropriate to the level of qualification being awarded.\nEnsure that there has been adequate consultation with other affected Schools, and that any comments or objections from these other Schools have been appropriately addressed.\nEnsure that the overall programme has coherence in terms of logic in structure, intellectual integrity and assessment methods being aligned with programme content, learning outcomes and learning and teaching activities.\nThe Panel can either:\nApprove (either outright or with minor changes which can be returned for final approval by Chair’s Action within an agreed timeframe)\nAsk for major revisions to be submitted to a future panel\nReject the proposal\nThe decision of the Programme Review Panel will be communicated by RAA to the School and other university stakeholders.\n4.10 Regulatory approval (UNM/UNNC only)\nProgrammes in UNM and UNNC will require a further approval from their respective local authorities before a programme is launched. In UNM approval is required from the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA) and the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE). In UNNC approval is required from the Ministry of Education (MOE). These additional approvals will be managed locally in UNM and UNNC.\n4.11 After the programme is approved\nAfter approval is obtained for the new programme (see previous steps), the programme will be created in the student records system, UCAS codes created (if applicable) and opened for marketing/recruitment.  Programme and module specifications will be published online in the Online Course Catalogue, which then becomes the definitive record.\nStudents may not be registered on a programme until the programme has been fully approved.\n5.0 Related regulations, policies and procedures\nFor further advice and guidance on any aspect of programme approval, please email:\nss-curriculumadvice@nottingham.ac.uk\nFor more information about the UoN Qualifications Framework, please see:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\nFor more information about making changes to programmes of study via the annual curriculum review cycle, please consult the following:\nChanges to programme specifications\nClosing or suspending a programme\nNew programme by change\nFor more information about the UK Quality Code for HE Advice and Guidance and QAA guidance, please see:\nUK Quality Code for Higher Education Advice and Guidance – Course Design and Development\nQAA Characteristic Statements\nQAA Subject Benchmark Statements\nFor more information about the University's minimum expectations relating to teaching and learning, please consult the following:\nMinimum expectations for levels of teaching and learning activity\nForms can be accessed here:\nNew Programme of Study - MS Form\nFor more information curriculum colleagues in RAA, please consult the following page:\nCurriculum Approvals and Advisory Team (internal SharePoint)\nFor more information about partnership approval process please consult the following:\nPartnership and Placements\nFor more information concerning programme specifications, please consult the following:\nProgramme specification guidance\nFor more information concerning module specifications, please consult the following:\nModule specification guidance\nFor more information relating to external advice in the programme approval process please consult the following:\nExternal advice in programme approval\nFor Programme Review panel dates, please consult the following:\nProgramme Review Panel dates (internal SharePoint)\n6.0 Version control table\nVersion control table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nChanges to clarify the process to request a new programme.

        "content": "Progression Review of research students - The University of NottinghamProgression Review of research students\nThis page sets out the Progression Review process which applies to research degree students in all years of their programme, including basic elements, possible outcomes and appeals. Its content is relevant to staff and postgraduate researchers registered for level 7 (masters) and level 8 (doctoral) degrees across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Please be aware that due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, some of the content on this page has now been updated as part of the University's mitigation efforts. Where this applies, it will be clearly indicated within each section below.\n1. Introduction\nIncludes:\nbasic principles; Progression Review activities throughout the year; progression monitoring; Internal Assessors; maximum time for completion of thesis examination\nAll postgraduate researchers (PGRs) registered on research degrees lasting more than 1 year full-time or 2 years part-time (e.g. MPhil or Professional Doctorates but not MRes etc.) are subject to progression monitoring and formal review.\nThe basic principles of Progression Review are common to all postgraduate researchers (PGRs) and all years of programmes who go through such a review.\nIn all cases, the purpose of Progression Monitoring and formal review is to ensure that the progress towards meeting the required outcomes at each Stage is sufficient to ensure achievement of the doctoral (level 8) or masters (level 7) outcomes to the required standard, and completion of the thesis examination (including any viva voce examination) within the period of registered study.\nFor more information about the UNQF, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\nRelevant adjustments may need to be made for PGRs studying away from the University or following programmes that involve a significant taught element.\nPart-time students\nFor part-time PGRs, all the processes for the Progression Review will happen every other year rather than yearly and periods of time quoted should be doubled.\nBasic principles of PGR progression monitoring and review\nProgress monitoring begins through regular supervisory meetings when the PGR first registers on the programme. These recorded meetings continue throughout the period of registered study and thesis completion period, until thesis submission. Formal records of these meetings should be made, agreed and held securely in the PGR’s supervision records. Progression Review information should be given to the PGR at Induction and then reinforced throughout their registered study.\nFor more information about responsibilities of the supervisor, please consult the following:\nResponsibilities of the Supervisor\nIn-year progress meetings with supervisory teams can be formal or informal, one-to-one or in a group, as is appropriate for the timing and progress of the PGR.\nFor the recommended steps and process in planning for PGR Progression Review, please consult the following:\nPGR Progression Review - Process Map\nPGR Progression Review consists of formal assessment of progress against the doctoral or other relevant published outcomes through several components.\nRecords of progress recorded in the required minimum number of regular supervisory meetings conducted regularly throughout the period of registered study, including information on: agreed research plans and milestones; progress made; any problems encountered and solutions proposed; and any other pertinent information. As these records form part of the formal assessment of PGR progression at Progression Review, they should contain a record of, for example, any extenuating circumstances, or any concerns about progress, or reasons for congratulation on success. Records of progress meetings should be available to all the team members, including the PGR and all supervisors.\nFor more information about responsibilities of the supervisor, please consult the following:\nResponsibilities of the Supervisor\nFormal Progression Review is assessed against progress towards meeting the required outcomes at each Stage of study in the programme, usually through a written report;\nCompletion of mandatory elements such as training and development, taught modules, laboratory rotations, career planning, engagement with professional development opportunities, and career planning are also reviewed.\nThe published criteria for Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 progression are badged against the outcomes in the University of Nottingham Qualification Framework and the QAA doctoral outcomes. They are designed to enable Assessors to take a consistent and transparent approach in determining the progress of PGRs.\nFor more information about Assessment criteria for Progression Reviews, please consult the following:\nAssessment criteria for Progression Reviews\nFormal assessment of progression at Stages 1 and 2 requires a meeting involving an Internal Assessor and should be held as an in-person or virtual event. The School may appoint more than one Internal Assessor if appropriate, for example if the research is inter/transdisciplinary in nature. In such instances all Internal Assessors should be actively engaged in all aspects of the formal Progression Review.\nThe appointment of the Internal Assessor(s) should be initiated within 3 months of registration and the PGR made aware of this, and the appointment should be confirmed at least 3 months before the formal Progression Review begins. It is strongly recommended that where possible the Internal Assessor(s) are involved in the Stage 3 Progression Review for continuity and quality assurance purposes. The Stage 3 Progression Review can be conducted by the supervisory team but should not be conducted by a single supervisor.\nFor more information on the role, responsibilities and appointment of the Internal Assessor, please consult the following:\nRole and responsibilities of the Internal Assessor\nProgression Reviews at Stages 1 and 2 should use the core Review elements below, and may include additional methods of assessment deemed necessary by Schools, to assess progress to date against the Stage appropriate published criteria. When including additional elements Schools must pay due regard to PGR and Assessor assessment load.\nIf progress is not sufficient to meet the necessary outcomes within the period of registered study, the aim must be to meet these, and complete the research and thesis examination within a maximum of three years (for MPhil) or four years from first registration (for PhD, MVM, MD, MVS, and professional doctorate) irrespective of programme duration. This maximum duration can only be changed in individual cases if the PGR holds an award with terms and conditions that vary this maximum period and the School approves the arrangement. Note that some awards may have a maximum duration of less than 4 years.\n2.  Timing of formal Progression Review and stages of PGR study\nIncludes:\nfor all PGRs; different stages of study; purpose and timing of formal Progression Reviews; 4 year PhD programmes with a substantial taught, training and development or laboratory rotation element in Stage 1; recommended latest timings for Stage 3 Progression Review.\nFormal assessment of progression through the Progression Review may take place at a time most appropriate for the PGR and/or be aligned with a School annual process. The Stage of PGR study is defined by their achievement and development but will generally align to year of study.  Schools can make adjustments to local progression timing, arrangements and requirements so long as the minimum elements of progression review are in place and completed by the required deadline for the PGR.\nIt is however strongly recommended that preparations for the formal Progression Review assessment should begin before the PGR has completed 9 months of each Stage / year of study and that reviews are held around the 9-month period. This is to allow for any supported improvement of progress and re-assessment to be completed within the year of study.\nFor non-doctoral PGRs (e.g. MPhil), Stage 1 Progression Review will usually align with year 1, and confirms satisfactory progress towards the UNQF level 7 outcomes. Stage 2 Progression Review indicates progress sufficient to allow thesis submission within 6 months. The Stage 2 Progression Review therefore happens at least 6 months before the end of the period of registered study.\nFor more information about the UNQF, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\nFor doctoral PGRs on 3 and 3.5 year programmes:\nDuring their first year of registration, the status of doctoral PGRs as PhD candidates is probationary. Stage 1 Progression Review will usually occur within the first year of study, confirms progress against the published criteria , and is also the point of confirmation of PhD registration status. Stage 2 Progression Review will usually take place in the second year of registered study and confirms sufficient progress to support probable achievement of doctoral outcomes within the next 12-18 months. Stage 3 Progression Review confirms a level of progress and achievement that shows that the PGR should achieve the doctoral outcome within 6 months (see the latest timings for Stage 3 Progression Review below).\nFor more information about Assessment criteria for Progression Reviews, please consult the following:\nAssessment criteria for Progression Reviews\nFor doctoral PGRs on 4 year programmes:\nFor 4 year doctoral programmes containing a large component of mandatory elements in the first year of registered study, such as substantial training and development requirements, taught modules, or laboratory / research project rotations, Stage 1 Progression Review may occur at the most appropriate time for the PGR depending on the programme, but must take place before the end of the second year. Recommendations on the registration of such PGRs on the PhD may be made at an earlier stage (e.g. after one year or 18 months), depending on the progress of the research alongside the mandatory taught or training elements of the programme.\nFor PGRs in doctoral training programmes or centres for doctoral training, where Stage 1 Progression Review is managed through the DTP/CDT.\nThe DTP/CDT programme is responsible for ensuring the PGR understands the process and timing of the Stage 1 review, and how their work in year 1 enables them to achieve the required outcomes . Thereafter, in Stages 2 and 3, the supervisors and School are primarily responsible for ensuring PGRs are prepared and fully understand the process and requirements of Progression Review.\nFor more information about Assessment criteria for Progression Reviews, please consult the following:\nAssessment criteria for Progression Reviews\nProgression Review after this takes place as described for the 3 / 3.5 year programmes.\nProgression review - Stages\nMPhil\nPhD\nNormal timing\nPurpose\nNormal timing\nPurpose\nStage 1\nYear 1\nConfirmation of sufficient progress towards level 7 outcomes, meeting outcome within 12 months\nYear 1/Year 2 [depending on length and structure of programme]\nConfirmation of sufficient progress and PhD registration\nStage 2\nYear 2\nConfirmation of sufficient progress for thesis submission within 6 months\nYear 2/Year 3 [depending on length and structure of programme]\nConfirmation of sufficient progress to meet doctoral outcomes within 12-18 months\nStage 3\nYear 3/Year 4\nConfirmation of sufficient progress for thesis submission within 6 months\nThe latest time at which Stage 3 Progression Review (confirmation that doctoral outcomes can be achieved within 6 months) can take place are in the table below.\nProgramme of study\nRecommended latest timing of Stage 3 Progression Review\nPhD: 3 years (36 months)\n30 months after initial registration, normally 18 months after Stage 1 Progression Review.\nPhD: 3 years, 6 months (42 months)\n36 months after initial registration, normally 24 months after Stage 1 Progression Review.\nPhD: 4 years\n42 months after initial registration, normally 30 months after Stage 1 Progression Review.\nIntegrated PhD\n42 months after initial registration, normally 30 months after Stage 1 Progression Review.\n1 year + 3 years (MRes/MSc + PhD)\n30 months after initial registration, normally 18 months after Stage 1 Progression Review.\nPhD: 4 years + 1 year extended training opportunities\n42 months after initial registration, normally 30 months after Stage 1 Progression Review.\nMPhil (normal expected period of study 2 years)\n6 months after Stage 1 Progression Review.\n3.  Minimum elements of Stage 1 and 2 Progression Review\nIncludes:\nfor all PGRs; for doctoral PGRs undergoing confirmation of registration; 4 year PhD programmes with a substantial taught, training and development or laboratory rotation element in Stage 1\nProgression Reviews at Stages 1 and 2 should use the core Review elements below to assess progress to date against the Stage appropriate published criteria, to enable the PGR to demonstrate that they have achieved the required outcomes at each Stage.\nFor more information about Assessment criteria for Progression Reviews, please consult the following:\nAssessment criteria for Progression Reviews\nWhen including any additional assessment methods, Schools must pay due consideration to assessment load and the balance of PGR workload for Progression Review against their ongoing research progress. It should not be expected that PGRs stop research / thesis writing in order to devote time to the Progression Review.\nSchools must ensure that the following elements are included in their formal Progression Review process:\nFor PGRs undergoing Stage 1 and Stage 2 Progression Review:\nA formal summative assessment of PGR progress to date. This is assessed against published criteria/outcomes by:\na)\na written report by the PGR on their progress to date and\nb)\nthrough questioning at a meeting between the PGR and the Internal Assessor and (if the School wishes, other staff who have not previously been closely associated with the PGR's work).\nThe meeting should have a clear agenda. It should begin with a reinforcement of what the meeting will cover and include opportunities to discuss progress to date, the PGR’s future research plans, and the extent of progress towards the doctoral outcomes, the wider research environment and its suitability to support the planned research, and the supervision the PGR receives.\nPlans for completion and submission of the thesis within the period of registered study, and completion of thesis examination in a maximum of 4 years, bearing in mind that PGRs do not have a dedicated ‘writing up’ period, and thesis writing should be integrated alongside the research.\nIndependent written assessments from the Internal Assessor and supervisory team* on the PGR’s performance to date. The Internal Assessor’s report should include information on PGR performance, progress, attendance and engagement throughout the period of study. Any problems encountered or required support identified by the PGR in discussion or in their written report should be noted in the Internal Assessor’s report, where appropriate. The report from the supervisory team should include any concerns with PGR progress to date, successes or problems encountered or necessary mitigations required to maintain progress.\nFormative feedback on how improvements might be made on both the written report and the meeting from the Internal Assessor. This can be verbal feedback at the end of the meeting.\nConfirmation that the required minimum number of supervision sessions has taken place, that the records of supervision meetings are available, and that these record the progress made to date and highlight any problems encountered.\nThe Internal Assessor should be able to access evidence that the PGR has attended any modules and passed any assessments that form a compulsory part of their research programme.\nThe content of any report submitted to a PGR’s sponsor, if they have one, should also be considered as part of the review.\nIn all these processes, the principal supervisor can represent the supervisory team but in doing so is expected to consult as necessary with other team members.\nNote that the Progression Reviews should also consider and take into account any significant research and/or personal impacts that have /may have significant disruptive impacts on research progress. Consideration of this should include information about how the PGR has managed to progress their research in light of any impacts, the extent to which they have mitigated these impacts and how they have had to change their research plans, activities, and goals/milestones accordingly.\nAfter the meeting with the PGR, the Internal Assessor and supervisors should share their independent reports with the PGR for their comment and response. If the likely recommendation is for reassessment, or if there is disagreement in outcome, the reports should be shared in a meeting with the Independent Assessor and/or the supervisors so the PGR has support when this is communicated. This can be during the verbal feedback after the meeting.\nIn light of the meeting, and discussion of the independent reports and the PGR response, the Internal Assessor and the principal supervisor should agree a joint recommendation on the outcome to the Head of School. The agreed joint recommendation will be recorded in the PGR’s record.\n4. Elements of Stage 3 Progression Review\nIncludes:\nconsideration of progress to thesis submission; minimum elements\nThe Stage 3 Progression Review should determine whether the PGR is likely to meet the doctoral outcomes within the next 6 months. It should include a detailed consideration of progress, including the progress made with writing the thesis, and a plan to ensure that the thesis is submitted within the period of registered study. If this is thought to be unachievable at Stage 3 Progression Review (for PGRs on 36 or 42 month programmes), plans must be made for degree completion, including thesis examination, within a maximum of 4 years from initial registration.\nIt is strongly recommended that the Internal Assessor is also involved in the Stage 3 Progression Review for continuity and quality assurance purposes.\nIn addition to the minimum elements of Stages 1 and 2 Progression Review, Stage 3 Progression Review should include the following elements:\na detailed evaluation of how the work to date shows that the PGR has already or will meet /achieve the doctoral outcomes.\nplans for the PGR to achieve any doctoral outcomes that are not yet met, showing how these will be met within 6 months;\ndetailed information on the progress made on writing the thesis, and plans for its completion (noting that the thesis is expected to be completed within the period of registered study, and a detailed plan for thesis completion and submission).\ndiscussion of any exceptional circumstances, unforeseen problems and mitigations that have been necessary to ensure progression and timely completion\nNote that if the required outcomes relating to the generation of empirical novel research contributions are unlikely to be met within 6 months, the PGR is unlikely to be able to progress to thesis submission and examination within 6 months.  In this case, the Internal Assessor and supervisors should consider the recommendation that the PGR does not progress and whether an exceptional extension to the period of registered study is required.\nAfter the meeting with the PGR, the Internal Assessor and supervisors should share their independent reports with the PGR for their comment and response. If the likely recommendation is for reassessment, or if there is disagreement in outcome, the reports should be shared in a meeting with the Independent Assessor and/or the supervisors so the PGR has support when this is communicated. This can be during the verbal feedback after the meeting.\nIn light of the meeting, and discussion of the independent reports and the PGR response, the Internal Assessor and the principal supervisor should agree a joint recommendation on the outcome to the Head of School. The agreed joint recommendation will be recorded in the PGR’s record.\n5. The possible outcomes of formal Progression Review\nIncludes:\noutcomes where assessors agree; recommendations on progression; circumstances and outcomes when progression is not recommended\nOutcomes where the Internal Assessor and supervisory teams agree:\n1. Progression to the next stage of study is recommended.\nIn order to make this recommendation there should be records that the PGR has been progressing according to plans throughout the year. Progress must be confirmed as satisfactory in the meeting through assessment against the stage-specific criteria, taking into account discipline / field specific differences in doctoral study and structure. The supervisors and assessors should agree that the PGR will be able to meet the doctoral outcomes in the required time.\nOutcomes of approved progression to the next stage of study are:\na) For Stage 1 PhD PGRs, confirmation of their status as PhD candidates.\nb) For Stage 1 and 2 progression, re-registration on the same degree in the following academic session.\nc) For all stages, provided the PGR agrees, the assessors can recommend a transfer of registration to another, usually higher, degree (e.g. from MPhil to PhD). In this instance, a transfer form must be completed. If a transfer is recommended at Stage 3, and the review did not involve an Internal Assessor, then an interview with the Internal Assessor is required to confirm the transfer to the new degree.\nd) For Stage 3 PGRs whose progress is satisfactory but who are likely to submit the thesis after the end of their period of registered study, the recommendation will be that on completion of the period of registered study they enter Thesis pending.\ne) For PGRs in Stage 3 who are achieving the necessary progress to meet the doctoral outcomes by the planned date, the recommendation will be maintenance of current status up to the end of their period of registered study.\nFor recommendations d) and e), the PGR must have met the requirements for the minimum period of registered study, completed the empirical research and not exceeded 4 years of study.\n2. Progression is not recommended and progress is required to be reassessed.\nFor this recommendation there will be information in the supervision records that the PGR and supervisory teams have discussed the reasons for unsatisfactory progress, and that attempts have been made to support the PGR to improve. The progress to date should have been assessed in the meeting with the Internal Assessor against the stage-specific criteria and found to be insufficient, taking into account discipline / field specific differences in doctoral study structure. The Internal Assessor and supervisory teams’ independent reports should agree that the PGR requires additional time and support to be able to demonstrate their ability to progress to the next stage at reassessment. In these cases, supervisory records must be kept, and should be available for the re-assessment.\na) Stage 1 PGRs on a supportive or corrective plan of action remain on probationary status until confirmation of Stage 1 progression.\nb) At all Stages PGRs are registered/re-registered for PhD in the following academic session with an agreed plan of supportive or corrective action in place for a limited time.\nc) For Stage 3 PGRs who have made insufficient progress in research and writing to allow them to meet the doctoral outcomes within the following 6 months, the assessors may recommend a reassessment after a period of up to 3 months. There should be a plan for supportive corrective action during this time to support the PGR to meet the doctoral outcomes by the end of the period of registered study.\nd) For Stage 3 PGRs who have made insufficient progress in research to allow them  to meet the doctoral outcomes and submit the thesis for examination within the following 6 months, the assessors may recommend an exceptional extension to the PGR’s period of registration for up to one further year. Reassessment for ability to progress to thesis  should be done after no more than 6 months. Thesis completion and examination are still expected within the 4 year maximum period.\ne) The maximum number of Progression Reviews for a PGR at any stage is limited to 2. If an Exceptional Circumstances claim is submitted and upheld, the Progression Review may be repeated as a First Sit.\n3. Progression is not recommended  - suggested change to registration status.\nAll Stages: With the agreement of the PGR and on recommendation in the joint report, transfer of registration to another degree (e.g. from PhD to MPhil, or MPhil to MRes). In this instance, re-assessment of progress is not required and a transfer form must be completed.\nThe reasons for a recommendation for reassessment or registration on another degree must be explained to the PGR as soon as possible.\nIn cases of referral for re-assessment, the PGR must have the opportunity to discuss the decision with the Internal Assessor and the supervisory team. If necessary, the PGR should be referred to the School Postgraduate Student Advisor (SPSA), Senior Tutor or other appropriate welfare support officer. The supervisory team should offer the PGR support in addressing the outcome of the review, and if necessary, in producing their response to the assessment in the reports.\n6. Resolution of disagreement on Progression Review recommendations\nIncludes:\nprocess to be followed to reach resolution on the recommendation for progression; timeline for resolution.\nIf the independent reports from the supervisory team and the Independent Assessor(s) disagree on the recommended outcome of the Progression Review, the following process should be followed.\nThe PGR should be referred to the supervisors, SPSA, Senior Tutor or other appropriate welfare support officer for support in addressing the outcome of the review, depending on where disagreement lies, and the required support. They should have the opportunity to discuss the Review with the supervisory team and / or Internal Assessor(s). They should have support in producing their response to the assessment either from the supervisors or from other members of the PGR support team. The PGR should receive the feedback from the review and be given an appropriate time to produce their response.\n1. If the Internal Assessor recommends progression but the supervisory team does not.\nThe independent and joint reports, and the PGR’s response, should be shared with the Head of School or delegate. The Head of School may call a meeting of the Internal Assessor, supervisors and PGR to discuss the case. The Head of School will then make a decision based on the information in the reports and from the discussion as to whether the PGR should progress, or be referred for reassessment.\nThe Head of School must consider whether delegation of this task to another person, such as an experienced PGR supervisor/assessor, the PGR Director or SPSA is preferable to ensure an independent perspective on the decision.\n2. If the supervisory team recommends progression but the Internal Assessor does not.\nThe supervisory team should set up a meeting for discussion of the proposed outcome to which the Internal Assessor; the PGR should also be invited and have made their response to the independent reports. The group should attempt to resolve the outcome by discussion. If there is information that is relevant to the discussion that was not available to the Internal Assessor in the Progression Review documentation and/or meeting and that might affect the judgement of progress, such as extenuating circumstances, this should be made available in the discussions. If agreement can be reached, then the recommendation will follow the process in Section 5.\nIf agreement on the outcome cannot be resolved through discussion, the case should be referred to the Head of School as in 1 above.\nSuch discussions should be held in a timely manner, aiming to reach a resolution and recommended outcome within 1 month of the Progression Review meeting.\n7. Requirements for Progression Review re-assessment and outcomes\nIncludes:\nreassessment of progress; support for PGRs\nIf progress needs to be reassessed at any stage, the PGR must be given detailed information on the goals and requirements for improved performance, an appropriate and defined timeframe in which to meet these, and support in achieving the required improvement. They should also be made aware of the possible outcomes of the reassessment process.\nThe format for re-assessment will be the same as for the initial Progression Review. The PGR should update their written report, focussing specifically on how they have met the agreed objectives. A plan for maintained progress should also be produced and considered at the re-assessment meeting.\nStage 1 PGRs are re-registered on a continued probationary basis until re-assessment. PGRs at stages 2 and 3 are re-registered/continue to be registered for the PhD until re-assessment.\nWhen a PGR is referred for reassessment, the following information must be provided to the PGR as soon as possible:\nFeedback on the performance in all aspects of the Progression Review, including clear detailed guidance on the requirements for improvement, with SMART objectives/goals and/or milestones;\nExplicit information on the potential outcomes of re-assessment;\nAn explicit time/date for the re-assessment of progress, which should give sufficient time for the required progress to be made. Normally this would not be more than 3 months after the original Progression Review. In exceptional circumstances and with the approval of QSC, the time given for improvement for PGRs at stages 1 and 2 may be up to 6 months;\nThe PGR must receive appropriate academic support and guidance to support them to achieve the required improvements. Academic support is particularly important for PGRs in progressing to Stage 3, to ensure that PGRs get on track to meet the required outcomes, and are prepared for the completion and examination of the thesis;\nIf necessary and appropriate, the PGR should be referred for support outside the supervisory team, e.g. welfare or disability support teams.\n8. Outcomes of Progression Review re-assessment\nIncludes:\nthe possible outcomes from re-assessment following satisfactory progress; outcomes on unsatisfactory progress; required evidence of progress.\nIf the Internal Assessor and the supervisors disagree on the recommendation after  reassessment, they should follow the process for resolution. This should include the Head of School irrespective of where the disagreement in recommendation lies.\nThe Head of School may delegate this task to an appropriate member of the PGR support team such as the PGR Director or SPSA.\nIf performance in the Progression Review re-assessment meets the stated criteria, and the required improvement has been made as agreed by the PGR and assessors, the recommendation by the School to the University should be that:\na) For Stage 1 doctoral PGRs, confirmation of their status as doctoral candidates.\nb) For Stages 1 and 2 progression, re-registration on the same degree in the following academic session.\nc) For Stage 3 PGRs whose progress is satisfactory but who are likely to submit the thesis after the end of their period of registered study, the recommendation will be that on completion of the period of registered study they enter Thesis pending.\nd) For Stage 3 PGRs who are on track to achieve the necessary progress to meet the doctoral outcomes by the planned date, and move to thesis submission, the recommendation would be maintenance of current status up to the end of their period of registered study at which point they would, if necessary, enter Thesis pending until thesis submission.\nFor recommendations c) and d), the PGR must have met the requirements for the minimum period of registered study, completed the research and have not exceeded 4 years of study. A recommendation for registration for a higher degree cannot be made as a result of progression re-assessment.\nIf performance in the re-assessment does not meet the criteria and the required progress / improvement has not been achieved as agreed by the supervisory team and Internal Assessor, the recommendation by the School to the University should be that, for all PGRs at all stages\nEither\na) the PGR is required to re-register on another, usually lower degree (e.g. PhD to MPhil, MPhil to MRes).\nOr\nb) the PGR’s registration is terminated.\nTermination of registration can only be recommended when supported by evidence that the PGR has received written warnings on lack of progress during the period of study, and the period of supported improvement.\nIn these cases, all supervisory records and Progression Review paper work must be submitted to QSC for approval.\n9. Considerations of Covid-19 or other major impacts\nWhere the recommendations to extend the PGR's registration status relate to research or personal impacts resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, the PGR can confirm the need for an extension to the 4 year maximum period, by either following the extension to the registered period of study, or the extension to Thesis pending procedure, depending on whether further research is deemed necessary or not.\nOther significant impacts on PGR progression, either personal or research-related, such as major disruption in access to facilities, should also be taken into account in Progression Review. When circumstances are out of the PGRs control, these should be considered fairly, with respect and consideration for the impact on the PGR.\nForms and documentation\nIncludes:\nflowchart for progression review and submission; progression review forms; request to register for an additional period of study; request to transfer student\nUK campus only\nSchool PGR Progression Review Form\nRequest to transfer studies (research degree)\nRegistration during thesis pending period form\nRequest to register a research student for an additional period of study\n*\n* this includes a section for Visa and Immigration team approval\nUNM campus only\nSchool PGR Progression Review Form\nRequest to transfer studies\nRequest to register a research student for an additional period of study\nUNNC campus only\nSchool PGR Progression Review Form (Probationary PhD students)\nSchool PGR Progression Review Form (excluding Probationary PhD students)\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nGraduate School - PGR\nGS-PGR@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n02 July 2024||"

        "content": "Alternative formats of thesis submission - The University of NottinghamAlternative formats of thesis submission\nThis page provides guidance about alternative formats of thesis submission. Its content is primarily directed at staff and students involved in the programmes indicated, across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Relationship with existing doctoral programmes and regulations\nThe regulations for the degrees listed below are the same as those which govern the PhD allowing for different submission formats:\nMusic\nCreative Writing\nDrama and Performance Practice as Research\nTranslation Studies\nAlternative formats for Music\n1.\nIn the case of MPhil/PhD students in Musical Composition, assessment is by submission of a portfolio of conventionally-notated compositions - in varying genres and for varying forces - initiated and completed during the period of study. These works will be developed through regular individual consultations with the supervisor. One of the compositions should be substantial and extended in length. The portfolio must be accompanied by a written commentary illuminating the composer’s methodology, aesthetic and communicative intentions, and their detailed evaluation of the portfolio when placed alongside contemporaneous works from other composers living both in this country and abroad. The commentary must also include precise analyses of selected aspects of the submitted compositions and must demonstrate how the candidate’s development of their compositional skills can be seen within the portfolio.\n2.\nFor submissions at MPhil level, the composition portfolio should amount to 40 minutes of music with a commentary of 12,000 words. The compositions should display originality of imagination and critical awareness of current issues, a high level of creative ability, a comprehensive understanding of techniques utilising instrumental and/or vocal and/or electro-acoustic resources, a systematic understanding of structural control and coherence and, where appropriate, impeccable skill and accuracy with regard to notation and presentation (whether calligraphic or computer-processed). Submitted compositions should be worthy of performance within a professional environment.\nFor submissions at PhD level, the composition portfolio should amount to 60 minutes of music with a commentary of 20,000 words. The compositions should display an original and imaginative contribution to contemporary music, an advanced level of creative ability, technical mastery in usage of instrumental and/or vocal and/or electro-acoustic resources, accomplished structural control and coherence and, where appropriate, impeccable skill and accuracy with regard to notation and presentation (whether calligraphic or computer-processed). Submitted compositions should be worthy of a professional standard of performance.\nAlternative formats for Creative Writing\n1.\nIn the case of MPhil/PhD students in Creative Writing assessment is by submission of an extended and original piece of creative work and a shorter critical evaluation in which this creative work and its contexts, are discussed and analysed. The creative element could be a novel, a manuscript of poems, a collection of short stories, a play, or another form of creative output, as required by the project.\n2.\nFor submission at MPhil level the word length of the creative element section will normally be 30,000 - 40,000 words (or equivalent, depending on genre or output as agreed with thesis supervisor), with a critical component of 10,000-20,000 words. The MPhil thesis should not normally exceed 60,000 words.\nFor submission at PhD level the word length of the creative element section will normally be 50,000 - 70,000 words (or equivalent, depending on genre or output as agreed with the supervisor). The critical component will involve a self-reflective and evaluative analysis about some aspect of the creative or research process and will normally be 15,000-30,000 words in length. This may involve any of the currently debated topics in English or Theatre Studies as they relate to the candidate's creative work: thematic or generic preoccupations, wider literary, theoretical, or poetic contexts, and so on. The PhD thesis should not normally exceed 100,000 words.\nAlternative formats for Drama and Performance Practice as Research\n1.\nIn the case of Drama and Performance MPhils/PhDs involving an element of practice as research assessment the thesis submission may include a performance work or works and a critical evaluation in which this performance practice is discussed and analysed. The form of the performance work will be negotiated with and approved by the supervisors but may be pilot/exploratory practice and/or a finished performance as required by the project.\n2.\nTaking the practice element into account, for submission at MPhil level the written component should not normally exceed 40,000 words and at PhD level should not normally exceed 60,000 words.\nAlternative formats for Translation Studies\nIn the case of MPhil/PhD students in Translation Studies, assessment may be either through submission of a thesis (which should be not more than 100,000 words for PhD or 60,000 words for MPhil), or through a combined extended translation and thesis option. The extended translation may be of material belonging to any genre, subject to prior approval. The accompanying thesis must engage with, and contribute to the development of, translation theory.\n1.\nFor submission at MPhil level, students opting for the translation and thesis option should submit an extended translation of 10,000 - 20,000 words. The translation should be of publishable or near-publishable standard. The translation should be accompanied by a thesis of 20,000 - 40,000 words. The total word-count for thesis plus translation together must be 40,000 - 60,000 words.\n2.\nFor submission at PhD level, students opting for the translation + thesis option should submit an extended translation of 20,000 - 40,000 words. The translation should be of publishable standard. The translation should be accompanied by a thesis of 45,000 - 80,000 words. The total word-count for thesis plus translation together must be 80,000 – 100,000 words.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nGraduate School - PGR\nGS-PGR@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n31 May 2024||"

Its contents are applicable to staff and students at the China and Malaysia campuses.Please note that students in the UK on a Student Route visa are also affected by the University's Policy on Immigration Sponsorship. Where academic policies and immigration policies seem to be contradictory, immigration policies will take precedence. For more information, please consult the following:\nImmigration sponsorship\nOverview\nIncludes:\nstudent responsibilities; link to the Policy on circumstances affecting students ability to study and complete assessments; voluntary interruption of study; school responsibilities; withdrawal on health and safety grounds; guidance for research students\n1.1\nStudents must organise their residential and other arrangements to facilitate attendance and engagement as required by their programme.\n1.2\nThe University monitors the attendance of its students and where required to will report non-attendance to the appropriate authorities.\n1.3\nStudents must attend all teaching activities necessary for the pursuit of their studies, undertake all associated assessments and attend meetings and other activities as required by their school or the University. The Policy on Circumstances Affecting Students' Ability to Study and Complete Assessments details the processes that students and schools should follow where a student’s ability to study or take assessments is in any way affected. Where students wish to interrupt their study, they should follow the University's procedure on voluntary interruption of study. Retrospective interruption of study is not permitted. For more information, please consult the following:\nPolicy on circumstances affecting students ability to study and complete assessments\nVoluntary interruption of study\n1.4\nIt is the responsibility of the school to ensure by suitable means (normally the course handbook) that students are aware of the requirements.\n1.5\nSchools may have formal means for recording attendance and engagement, but there is no requirement that a systematic register is taken in order to follow this procedure.\n1.6\nThe intention of this procedure is to ensure that students are engaging appropriately with the University and to provide a framework for managing non-engagement.\n1.7\nIn the case of all students where responsibility is shared between schools, the owning school should ensure that any partner schools are informed of issues and the partner schools should involve the owning school in any processes relating to this policy.\n1.8\nThe University has a policy regarding students required to withdraw temporarily or permanently on grounds of health and safety and it may be appropriate to manage non-attendance through that procedure rather than through these regulations. For more information, please consult the following:\nStudents required to withdraw on grounds of health and safety\n1.9\nAnnual leave for research students should be in accordance with the relevant guidance and where students do not comply with this they may be managed under this policy.\nResponsibilities of the student (PGR)\nManagement of non-engagement\nIncludes:\ntaught course students - non-engagement with one or more modules; research students - non-attendance at supervision; all students -  total absence\nTaught course students: non-engagement with one or more modules\nThis procedure applies where a student, in the opinion of their School, is not engaging with all activities necessary for the pursuit of their studies or is not submitting required formative assessments, but is attending some activities. Where students are attending no activities, the guidelines in the All students - total absence box applies.\nWhere a student has notified current or intended absence\n2.1.1\nA student who knows that they will be absent from the University for any period of time should make this known to their School, Division or Department in order that appropriate discussions can take place.\n2.1.2\nA student whose absence is unplanned should inform their School, Division or Department immediately that they are absent in order that appropriate discussions can take place.\n2.1.3\nThe School and student should discuss how long the likely absence will be and what effect this may have on the student’s ability to undertake their programme satisfactorily.  When the absence is with good cause, the School will where possible be flexible in responding to the needs of individual students.\n2.1.4\nIf the absence is for a period of more than two weeks or any period considered to be significant by the School and notified to students (normally in the Course Handbook), the School may require the student to suspend their studies and return at a specified time in the future that will enable the student to resume the programme appropriately. In making the decision the School should take into account all the circumstances of the individual, including health and safety aspects, and the requirements of the programme and may specify that on their return a student will be required to take alternative modules to those originally taken.\n2.1.5\nAt any point in this process the School may seek advice and guidance from the Head of Student Services or a member of the University Health Service, including advice on personal matters that the student has given consent for them to discuss, and advice on referrals to University services. Advice is also available from the Students’ Union.\n2.1.6\nWhere the School wishes the student to suspend and the student does not wish to voluntarily interrupt their study the recommendation to suspend should be forwarded by the School to the Head of Student Administration for consideration on behalf of the Quality and Standards Committee (QSC).  If the School’s recommendation is ratified the student will be required to suspend.\nWhere a student has not notified absence\n2.1.7\nIf a student is not attending the requisite timetabled sessions and/or not undertaking the requisite formative assessments, the module convenor should inform the student's Head of School or a member of that School's staff with delegated responsibility. The School should ascertain the extent of non-engagement by contacting all relevant module convenors, and then take appropriate steps, normally including interviewing the student, to ascertain the reason for non-engagement. If the School does not receive a satisfactory explanation for absence or non-completion of work, the School should send a written warning to the student, stating the course of action (described in 2.1.8 below) that will occur if the situation does not improve sufficiently.\n2.1.8\nThe School should ask the module convenor(s) to report on whether the warning has the desired effect. If non-engagement continues, the School may either:\n(a)\ninform the student that a mark of 0% has been awarded for all remaining assessments (including examinations) on the module(s) affected. Where this action leads to the module(s) being failed and the student subsequently being unable to progress under the relevant regulations, the School can decide that the module be reassessed the following session and specify whether the student must be in attendance, rather than arranging a reassessment for the student in August/September.\nor\n(b)\nfollow the procedure in paragraphs 2.1.4 and 2.1.6 (above), resulting in the suspension of the student’s registration for the remainder of the session.\nResearch students: non-attendance at supervision and other activities\nThis section of the procedure applies when the non-attendance is not covered by evidence of extenuating circumstances and where:\nThe student is missing or cancelling supervision meetings to the extent that, if continued, it is unlikely that the minimum number of supervision will take place in the session; or\nThe student is not attending satisfactorily such other activities (for example, laboratory sessions) deemed by the supervisor to be requisite to the student's research studies; or\nThe student is deemed by the supervisor not to be engaging appropriately with their research.\nWhere the student is not engaging at all, the procedure in the All students - total absence section (below) should be followed.\n2.2.1\nThe supervisor should inform the student's Head of School or a member of that School's staff with delegated responsibility. The School should take appropriate steps, normally including interviewing the student, to ascertain the reason for non-engagement. If the School does not receive a satisfactory explanation, the School should send a written warning to the student that the non-engagement will feature in the student's progression review and may influence the outcome of the review, possibly with the result that the student's programme will be terminated. In the case of continued inadequate engagement following a warning, the School may also consider bringing forward the progression review.\nIf this action is taken, the expectation would be that the normal progression review cycle is also maintained, but if the extra review is held within three months of the normally expected date the School may decide not to hold another review until the following year.\nAll students - total absence\n2.3.1\nIf reports to the School indicate that a student is not attending any modules, supervision or other required activities such as practice based placements and the student provides no explanation for this non-attendance when invited to do so, the matter should be referred to the Student Service Centre (or its equivalent on University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) or University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC)). The Student Service Centre will write to the student stating that they will be deemed to have withdrawn from the University unless a reply to the contrary is received within a specified time period. If a student is deemed to have withdrawn their registration as a student will be discontinued in accordance with the Regulations Governing Registration.\nFor more information about these regulations, please consult the following page:\nRegulations governing registration\n2.3.2\nWhere a student does provide either the School or the Student Service Centre with an explanation for their absence, the School must determine whether the explanation provides good cause for the absence. If the explanation offered does not establish good cause, the student should be dealt with under the procedure contained in 2.1.7 and 2.1.8 (in the Taught course students: non-engagement with one or more modules box) above in respect of all modules, or under 2.2.1 (in the Research students: non-attendance at supervision and other activities box) above if a research student.\n2.3.3\nIf a student has zero attendance and the School has no knowledge at all as to the student's whereabouts the School should contact the Student Service Centre (or its equivalent on UNM or UNNC) and the emergency contact protocol will be applied.\nFor more information about the emergency contact protocol, please consult the following:\nEmergency contact protocol\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n21 June 2024||"

        "content": "Postgraduate researchers studying away/in outside organisations - The University of NottinghamPostgraduate researchers studying away/in outside organisations\nThis page provides information for postgraduate researchers who wish to apply to conduct their research studies away from the University of Nottingham. Its content is relevant to staff and postgraduate researchers across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.1. Introduction\nThe research study of any postgraduate researcher may in appropriate cases take place away from Nottingham. This may be another higher education institution, a non-academic collaborating organisation, or another location where the candidate will continue to progress their research work or thesis.\nThis includes where the candidate will be progressing their research or thesis at:\nA collaborating organisation that does not form a part of the University of Nottingham\nAn overseas location for fieldwork or similar purposes\nA location from which it is not possible to readily commute to a University of Nottingham campus\nA home or other overseas location\nSuch arrangements may apply equally to full-time and part-time postgraduate researchers and may cover all or part of the total period of directed study including thesis pending in the case of UNUK and UNM registered students on a visa.\nPostgraduate researchers wishing to study for more than 4 weeks away from a University of Nottingham campus must make a request to the University about the arrangements for this, by completing the study away form:\nStudy away from the University form\nStudy away from the University form\nStudy away from the University form\nPGR students must have completed registration and commenced their doctorate before an application for study away from the university can be made. PGRs cannot commence their study away from the University except in the case of PGRs on collaborative arrangements where the formal agreement specifies this.\nCompletion of the study away notification form is not required for postgraduate researchers who are part of a partnership agreement, exchange or mobility scheme, or any other formalised external study.\n2. Application of regulations\nAll postgraduate researchers who study for part or all of their research degree away from Nottingham are subject to the normal regulations and procedures covering research students. The University of Nottingham supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the researcher complies with all programme requirements, such as, but not limited to supervisions and Monitoring and Progression Reviews whilst they are studying away. In addition, the following special considerations should be incorporated into the management of the student/programme.\n3. Collaborative arrangements\nIncludes:\nMemorandum of Agreement; local supervision at collaborating institutions; availability of facilities at collaborating institutions; level of support at collaborating institutions\nMany collaborative arrangements will arise from a formal Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) either at School or institutional level with another institution.\nIn such cases the MOA should outline the supervisory arrangements and programmes of study for the candidates involved in the collaborative agreement, and may include special arrangements for examination.\nIn other cases the collaboration will be between individual members of academic staff and in such cases the supervisory arrangements and programme of study should be considered on an individual basis.\nAll candidates who are accepted for admission to a research degree which will require periods of time to be spent away from the University at a collaborating institution must be informed of their outline programme of study and any supervisory arrangements at the time the offer of admission is made.\n3.1 Local supervision at the collaborating institution\nWhere the postgraduate researcher is studying at a collaborating organisation, they will in addition to their University of Nottingham supervisors also usually have a local supervisor in the organisation in which they will be working.  The local supervisor must have an appropriate level of understanding of the academic area of the candidate’s topic of research. The local supervisor would normally be expected to be a postdoctoral member of staff, or of equivalent status, at the outside organisation concerned and may in some instances be an Honorary Professor or Honorary Lecturer of the University of Nottingham.\nThe School must notify Registry and Academic Affairs of the names and qualifications of any local supervisors and the supervision arrangements that have been put in place.\n3.2 Availability of facilities at collaborating institutions\nIn accepting or permitting study away from the University at collaborating institutions for extended periods, it is the responsibility of the Head of School to ensure that the essential facilities, including laboratory and library facilities, at the collaborating organisation are suitable and will allow the candidate to conduct their research at a satisfactory level. In addition, the Head of School should ensure that, as far as can reasonably be foreseen, the facilities and resources will continue to be available for the duration of the postgraduate researcher’s period of registered study.\n3.3 Level of support at collaborating institutions and external organisations\nIn all cases the Head of School should ensure that the arrangements for study and supervision at the external institution/organisation provide an appropriate level of support and reflect the ethos of the University's quality assurance framework.\nWhere practice varies between the University and another institution, the School should ensure that the support provided is at least equivalent to that defined in the Quality Manual, although the detail may vary.\nPostgraduate researchers should be made aware of the individual arrangements that apply to them and where the precise Quality Manual arrangements will not apply.\n4. Field or archive-based study away from the University\nWhere the postgraduate researcher is applying to study away in order to conduct fieldwork or archival research, this must comply with the University Health and Safety Travel and Off-site Working (including fieldwork) policy and guidance. For more information please consult the following page:\nTravel and off-site working (including fieldwork) policy\n5. Other circumstances in which study away may be permitted\n5.1 For postgraduate researchers registered in the UK\nPostgraduate researchers registered in the UK may be permitted to study away from the University including from either a UK location distant from Nottingham (from which it is not possible to readily commute to a University of Nottingham campus), or an overseas location when they have no current requirement for physical access to on-campus research facilities. In such circumstances the Head of School/Director of PGR Study should be assured that suitable remote supervisory and other arrangements are in place to enable the candidate’s research to progress and enable their engagement in relevant training and research activities.  In such cases the fact that study was being undertaken away from the University cannot later be given as the reason for lack of progress or for the candidate’s inability to engage with or attend any mandatory course requirements.\nWhere a candidate is following a programme under a formal Collaborative Arrangement agreement study away will only be possible if specifically stated in the Memorandum of Agreement.\nInternational postgraduate researchers on a visa should seek advice from the visa and immigration team before making an application under these circumstances.\n5.2 For postgraduate researchers registered in UNNC and UNM\nPostgraduate researchers registered at UNNC and UNM may be permitted to study away from the University when they have no requirement for physical access to on-campus research facilities. Postgraduate researchers should seek advice from their campus Graduate School and Visa and Immigration Team before making an application.\nIn such circumstances the Head of School/Director of PGR Study should be assured that suitable remote supervisory and other arrangements are in place to enable the candidate’s research to progress and enable their engagement in relevant training and research activities.  In such cases the fact that study was being undertaken away from the University cannot later be given as the reason for lack of progress or for the candidate’s inability to engage with or attend any mandatory course requirements.\n6. Consideration of training needs and requirements\nIt is the responsibility of the School or Doctoral Training Programme, in conjunction with supervisors, to identify the training needs of individual postgraduate researchers, to ensure needs are met and to determine the means by which they are met. How completion of any mandatory training requirements will be met must be considered as part of any application to study away.\nWhere possible research training should be undertaken at the University of Nottingham. However, some training may be more appropriately provided at a collaborating institution or external organisation.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nGraduate School - PGR\nGS-PGR@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n20 June 2024||"

Its content is primarily directed at staff but may also be of interest to students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.1.0 Purpose\nThis page outlines when and how changes to curriculum (for programme and module specifications) can be made. This includes approval for changes to micro-credential programmes offered by UoNO\nNote, deadlines and processes vary by campus due to different regulatory environments.\n2.0 Key principles\n2.1 Principles of curriculum review\nIt is good practice for Schools to review their curriculum (that is, programme and module specification information and curriculum maps) on an annual basis. For example, this may follow local annual monitoring or other teaching review procedures.\nIt is also necessary for Schools to annually check the accuracy of their published curriculum information, which includes the Online Course Catalogue and prospectus. Prospective students need to be able to rely on the published information in the Online Prospectus to make decisions about what and where to study. Also, the experience of students on a particular programme and/or module should reflect the curriculum information in the Online Course Catalogue.\nThe annual curriculum review is different to annual monitoring, although the same source datasets are likely to be used for both. For example, External Examiner reports, student and staff feedback. For more information about annual monitoring please see here:\nAnnual monitoring\nThese curriculum reviews may lead to a need to make changes to that curriculum, which should be approved by School and Faculty following the relevant local processes.  The curriculum review and School/Faculty approval can occur at suitable times agreed locally and in advance of the deadlines for submission of curriculum changes.  In the UK, there will be different implementation schedules for material curriculum changes compared to changes which are not material.\nDuring the annual review, schools must consider whether maintaining the non-compensatable status of a module is still essential.  This assessment should consider if a non-compensated pass is required for future study (serving as a pre-requisite for a subsequent compulsory module), achieving the programme’s learning outcomes, or meeting accreditation requirements\nIt is important that the quality manual regulations in relation to new programmes and new modules are considered.  Any changes to existing programmes and modules should comply with the new programme and module regulations (unless an exceptional case has been approved by the Quality and Standards Committee).\nSchools must consider the impact of any planned curriculum change on all stakeholders, which may include prospective students, current students, other programmes of study in the School, other Schools, partnerships and the China and Malaysia campuses. In the UK, consultation with students, including prospective students, may be necessary to ensure adherence to Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) guidelines.\n2.2 Implementing curriculum changes\nTo implement the School/Faculty approved curriculum changes, it is necessary for those changes to be amended centrally. The curriculum record is held in the Student Record Systems and consists of Programme and Module Specifications and curriculum maps.  This is also the lead source for prospectus information.  Registry and Academic Affairs (RAA) in the UK or local Academic Services Unit (ASU) at UNNC or Student Registry Office (SRO) at UNM are responsible for maintaining the formal, approved record of curriculum.\nDeadlines for submission of curriculum changes vary slightly across the three campuses and are circulated to schools in the respective campuses ahead of the deadlines detailed below.\nIn UNM/UNNC, there is one annual opportunity to update curriculum, managed by SRO and ASU respectively. Information is cascaded locally regarding how to request those changes.  These changes (for all necessary changes) are usually made in January/February prior to the start of the academic year of implementation.\nIn the UK, curriculum changes are submitted at two time points depending on whether that information is “material” or not. Information is cascaded locally regarding how to request those changes. Subsequent change to material and non-material information in the UK is not normally permitted unless in exceptional and unforeseen circumstances (see late change).\nChanges for material items must be submitted in line with the deadlines ahead of the UG/PGT Prospectus publication. Typically, Schools will be asked to do this by November/December annually for UG programmes and March-May for PGT programmes (e.g. November 2024 for September 2026 UG start).\nChanges for non-material items must be submitted according to the annual curriculum review process and timeline. Typically, Schools will be asked to do this by November annually for all programmes (e.g. November 2025 for September 2026).\nMaterial information includes (but is not limited to):\nWhich modules are core modules,\nprogramme title,\nlocation of study,\nduration of study,\nexternal accreditation,\naward type,\nassessment at programme level,\ndelivery of teaching at programme level.\nPlease see\nAppendix 1\nof the University of\nUniversity of Nottingham's Consumer Protection Policy\nwhich provides a full list of information which is considered “material”.\nPlease note, UK prospectus publication dates are shown in the table below:\nUK Prospectus Publishing dates for UG and PGT programmes\nUndergraduate\n1 March in the calendar year before students commence the course (e.g. 1 March 2025 for 26/27 entry with changes to prospectus information being completed by 1 December 2024)\nPostgraduate Taught\n1 July in the calendar year before students commence the course (e.g. 1 July 2025 for 26/27 entry with changes to prospectus information being completed by 1 April 2025)\n2.3 Late changes to curriculum\nIt is expected that once the prospectus and Online Course Catalogue are published, no further changes to curriculum information will be made unless essential. Every effort should be made to submit changes to curriculum within the relevant process timeframes. It is however accepted that there may occasionally be a need to make further changes to the curriculum for essential and/or unforeseen reasons after the relevant process deadlines.\nChanging material information at any point following the prospectus publication will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances, which might include responding to PSRB, employer or accreditation changes/requirements, or where the change clearly benefits or enhances the student experience.\nLocal School/Faculty approvals must first be obtained.  Then, RAA in UNUK or local academic services unit in UNM/UNNC will consider the change, consulting with other departments for advice as necessary (e.g., Legal Services, Governance and Marketing), and then make a recommendation to the relevant AFPVC (or delegate) who will accept or reject the request.\nProspective students, specifically applicants and offer holders, and students where impacted must be informed in writing of any changes to material information that has been published in the Online Prospectus or Online Curriculum Catalogue. In some circumstances consultation may be required.\nAll communications to prospective students regarding changes to material information will be managed by Admissions and Marketing in consultation with the School. All current student communications regarding material changes will be managed by the School/Faculty.  All communications are drafted in consultation with RAA and the School and, where appropriate, the Legal team.\n2.4 Free speech\nWhen developing a new programme, appropriate regard must be given to the importance of promoting free speech.\nPlease consult the following for further information about the Freedom of Speech Act:\nThe UUK document ‘How can Universities prepare for the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act?\nOffice for Students guidance on free speech.\n2.5 Academic freedom\nIn relation to programme and module development, approval, and delivery, it should be noted that academics would not be prohibited from developing or delivering a programme or module on the ground that it involves giving serious consideration to ‘controversial or unpopular opinions’. This is not a reason that the programme would be approved, rather it is not a reason it could be declined. For instance, there will remain business or logistical reasons to not grant approval to a programme or module.\n3.0 Related regulations, policy and procedures\nFor more information about changes to Curriculum:\nChanges to programme and module specifications\nFor more information about Consumer Protection Policy (includes list of material information in Appendix 1):\nUniversity of Nottingham's Consumer Protection Policy\nFor more information about UK curriculum change and deadlines, including information about how to submit late change requests in the UK:\nCurriculum Approvals and Advisory Team (CAAT) SharePoint (internal UK only)\nTo view the published curriculum:\nOnline Course Catalogue\nNew/revised curriculum maps are required with all programme specification changes.  A template for a curriculum map can be found here:\nCurriculum map\nFor more information about any aspect of curriculum change, please email:\nss-curriculumadvice@nottingham.ac.uk\n4.0 Version control table\nVersion control table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nChanges made to reflect the different stages of process for largely CMA reasons.  Also reformatted to align with new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework\nQSC\nAugust 2024\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n20 September 2024||"

Its contents are primarily directed at staff but may also be of interest to students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses, as well as to prospective students.1.0 Purpose\nThese guidelines have been drafted to comply with the requirements of Principle 7 of the UK Quality Code for Higher Education ‘Designing, developing, approving and modifying programmes’ and the expectation that higher education providers produce information for their intended audiences about the learning opportunities they offer that is fit for purpose, accessible and trustworthy.\n2.0 Scope\nThese contents are relevant to staff, and may also be of interest to current or prospective students, across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.\n3.0 Key principles\n3.1 Information for prospective students\nThe University undertakes to provide appropriate and sufficient information to prospective students to enable them to select their programme of study, and to know what will be expected of them when they register to study at the University.\nThis information is available through a variety of routes, including open days, virtual open days or offer holder events, the prospectus, the University’s web pages, videos and social media channels. Guidance and advice is available from staff in schools, the Admissions Office and staff in the Student Recruitment Team’s Enquiry Centre to assist prospective students through the applications process.\nIn addition, information is available about the University’s teaching and learning facilities, student life at Nottingham, support services, opportunities for exchanges and study abroad, as well as information about employability of graduates as part of the requirement to provide course information through the Key Information Set.\n3.2 Information for current students\nThe University has agreed that there must be a minimum level of information which must be provided for undergraduate and postgraduate students about their chosen programme of study. Additionally, students must know at the start of their course an overview of how their courses will be taught and assessed.\nThe following comprises information which School and teaching groups must supply and some suggestions for layout and style. The information which is supplied to students about their course must be accurate. It is reasonable for the more detailed information to follow after the start of the academic year, particually if students know when that information will be provided.\nInformation must be supplied about the following:\n3.2.1 Course information\nA description of what a modular course comprises, definitions of terms – for example, what is a module, what is compensation.\nFull details of the course structure and philosophy – for example, how the course progresses, the main themes running through the course, the aims.\nSpecific skills that may be required during the course – for example, essay writing, giving presentations, basic computing skills, and when they will be required.\nPolicy on possible module choices within and outside the home School or teaching group.\n3.2.2 Assessment information\nThe purpose, methods and schedule of assessment tasks both during and at the end of a module or programme of study.\nFor each module, the format of the assessment(s), including, for written examinations, whether it is essay questions or multiple choice questions (MCQs).\nThe criteria for assessment including, where appropriate, descriptors of expected standards of student attainment; what is expected in order to pass or to gain a particular grade or classification.\nWhich elements will – and which will not – count towards interim or final assessment and with what weighting or exemption procedures.\nThe marking and grading conventions that will be used.\nThe consequences of assessment, such as decisions about progression to the next level, final awards and the right of appeal\nPlagiarism – the definition and the penalties (as laid out in the Regulations Governing Suspected Academic Misconduct), including examples of acceptable referencing techniques.\nHow and when assessment judgements are published.\nAny opportunities for re-assessment.\nPolicy on the late submission of work.\n3.2.3 Other\nThe minimum standards expected of both staff and students – for example, the dates for handing in essays, the dates by which marked work will be returned to students by staff.\nChannels of communication – that is, how students make their views known, how they receive feedback on their views (for example, Student Staff Fora (SSFs)).\nRole of tutor, giving definitions of academic, personal and year tutor as appropriate, and what sort of queries each deals with.\nTimes when tutors are available and the policy on availability.\nPurchase of books – recommended texts, price, when they will be required during the programme.\nWeek-by-week course details – that is, what will be taught in each week of the programme.\nWhen to start applying for jobs, postgraduate opportunities and who to approach as referees.\nInformation about administrative office hours.\n3.2.4 Format for information\nBooklets are preferable to loose sheets.\nStyle should be `user-friendly' – that is, an explanation should be provided for technical terms where appropriate.\nEnglish should be used, blocks of text could be broken up by putting important points or ideas in boxes.\nBooklets specific to the year of the student's course are useful since they ensure that information is imparted at the point in the programme when the students need to know it, rather than overloading students with extraneous information at the start of the programme. A general introductory booklet (supplemented by specific year booklets) is the best approach.\n3.2.5 Plagiarism\nEach School or department should have an appropriate mechanism in place for recording that a student has read and understood the guidelines on plagiarism, and that their work falls within those guidelines.\n3.3 Information for students on completion of studies\nStudents are entitled to receive a full record of their academic achievements when they leave their programme of study. Degrees and diplomas are conferred at a degree ceremony. If a graduand is unable to attend the ceremony the degree will be conferred in absentia and certificates will be sent six to eight weeks after the ceremonies have finished. Students graduating from 2006 onwards will also receive a diploma supplement at the same time as they receive their degree certificate.\nThroughout the period of study, students are able to request transcripts of their marks and to see information about their programmes, including modules and marks, by way of the MyNottingham app.\n4.0 Related Regulations, Policies and Procedures\nFor more information about the UK Quality Code for Higher Education and the qualification types and structures in use at the University of Nottingham, please consult the folowing:\nUK Quality Code for Higher Education\nQualification types and structures\nFor more information about the diploma supplement, please consult the following Student Services page.\nStudent Services - Diploma Supplement page\n5.0 Version control table\nVersion control table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nReformatted to align with new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework\nQSC\nAugust 2024\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please email:\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n06 August 2024||"

        "content": "UoN microcredential regulations - The University of NottinghamUoN microcredential regulations\nThis section contains the University's microcredential study regulations. These pages are only applicable to learners but may also be of interest to staff across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses, and in particular those staff within UoNO.1. Overview\nUnless specified otherwise all sections within the University’s Quality Manual apply to Learners enrolled or enrolling with UoNO.\nFor the purposes of the regulations contained within the Quality Manual, Learners study microcredentials (rather than modules) and are to be treated as students of the University of Nottingham (where a regulation refers to ‘student’, it also includes ‘learner’). Microcredentials are small (in time to study) learning blocks, which may or may not be credit bearing.\nFor the purposes of those directly linked regulations, UoNO is to be treated as a School or Department of the University of Nottingham.\nIn all Microcredentials, UoNO follows the\nPolicy on e-learning and distance learning\n.\n2. Enrolment\n2.1\nThe enrolment processes will be managed by the University of Nottingham, Online (UoNO) as a part of the University of Nottingham.  UoNO learners must enrol via the UoNO webpages.\n2.2\nA learner enrolled on a credit-bearing UoNO Microcredential may not concurrently hold the status of a registered student at the University of Nottingham.\n2.3\nLearners may enrol direct onto individual microcredentials, but not onto a degree programme\n3. Assessment\n3.1\nThe Quality Manual\npages on assessment\nprovide most of the information learners will require in order to understand how assessment is regulated.\n3.2\nKey differentiating regulations  for UoN Learners:\n3.2.1\nAll Assessment must be completed electronically and submitted through the UoNO platform.\n3.2.2\nEach assessment and Microcredential will be awarded a grade of either a pass or a fail. The award of a pass will be made where the Learner has demonstrated mastery of each assessed competency at or above the level detailed in the competency standards. Feedback will be provided and marks returned, normally within 28 working days.\n3.2.3\nA learner enrolled on a microcredential may stay enrolled on that microcredential for a maximum of 12 months from the date of registration, unless there are\nextenuating circumstances\n.\n3.2.4\nAll Microcredentials will permit the submission of assessment at three submission points throughout the enrolment period of the Learner’s enrolment on the Microcredential. Learners may submit to more than one submission point in order to pass the Microcredential. They receive feedback each time they submit.  It is the responsibility of the Learner to ensure that they are aware of the date of each submission point and that they submit within the required timeframe.\n3.2.5\nThe\nExtenuating Circumstances\nregulation applies to all Microcredentials offered by UoNO and provides Learners with details on how they can apply to extend their enrolment for a Microcredential. The impact of an extension to enrolment can be to give a Learner another assessment submission at a later date.\n3.2.6\nIt is the responsibility of UoNO to ensure that submission points are clearly advertised through the UoNO platform.\n3.2.7\nIf a Learner fails to submit their assessment by the last submission point, UoNO will issue them with a ‘Fail: No Resit/Resubmission’ for their Microcredential result. The same outcome will be issued if a Learner does not pass all the required assessments during the enrolment period. Learners will not be allowed another opportunity to submit assessment and will not be eligible to repeat study of that Microcredential at a reduced fee. Should a Learner wish to repeat study of that Microcredential at a later date, they will need to re-enrol for their Microcredential on the UoNO platform and pay the Microcredential fee in full. It will be at the discretion of the UoNO enrolment team as to whether a re-enrolment will be permitted.\n3.2.8\nLate submissions without an approved ‘\nExtenuating Circumstances\n’ claim are not normally permitted.   Extensions to submission points are not permitted, excepting cases in which the UoNO submission platform suffers from a documented failure within 24 hours of a submission point. .\n3.2.9\nAny Learner needing to withdraw should consult the non-academic terms and conditions.\n4. Putting Microcredentials towards a qualification\n4.1\nIf a Learner enrols onto a Microcredential and satisfies all of the competency requirements, then they will be awarded the Microcredential. Some Microcredentials are credit bearing and some are not.\n4.2\nIf a learner is awarded a Microcredential, they may be able to count that towards a University of Nottingham qualification. Only a limited number of qualifications expressly state that they will accept Microcredentials. Where they do so, the programme specifications will outline which Microcredentials may be counted towards the qualification and how many credits they will contribute.\n4.3\nOnly those University of Nottingham Qualifications that expressly state that they will permit the counting of Microcredentials towards the University of Nottingham qualification are committed to doing so. These qualifications must satisfy the University of Nottingham\nProgrammes\nregulations.\n4.4\nCourses expressly stating that they will permit the counting of Microcredentials towards UoN qualifications may do so through one of three structures:\n4.4.1\nAn open pathway combined studies award (PG Cert or PGDip). For this award to be made, Learners will need to pass Microcredentials through UoNO that collectively count for 60 (PG Cert) or 120 (PGDiP) credits within the Combined Studies programme specification.\n4.4.2\nA restricted studies award (PG Cert or PGDiP). For this award to be made, Learners will need to pass specific, named Microcredentials that collectively count for 60 (PG Cert) or 120 (PGDiP) credits within the relevant programme specification.\n4.4.3\nA directed studies award (PC Cert or PGDiP). For this award to be made, Learners will need to pass specific, named Microcredentials, in a specific order, and that collectively count for 60 (PG Cert) or 120 (PGDiP) credits within the relevant programme specification\n4.5\nA Learner who satisfies the conditions for a directed studies award, may not be made a restricted or open pathway award.\n4.6\nFor all such awards, Learners may only be made the award at a pass (awards of merit and distinction are not available).\n4.7\nOther courses may, at the discretion of the relevant School, count Microcredentials towards a University of Nottingham qualification under the\nRecognition of Other Learning\nregulations.\n5. Feedback, Complaints and Appeals\n5.1\nUoNO will provide an online mechanism for Microcredential Learners on each Microcredential to provide feedback on the quality of teaching and materials for each Microcredential.\n5.2\nUoNO will also periodically provide access to an online forum (Student Staff Fora) where Microcredential Learners can discuss with one another the strengths of and any concerns that they have with any given Microcredential. UoNO will consider this feedback three times per year, and report to the Microcredential Learner community any changes that will be made or that are planned, as a result.\n5.3\nUoN has student\ncomplaints and student appeals policies\nthat are open to Microcredential Learners. Microcredential Learners wishing to lodge a complaint or appeal must use procedure described.\n6. Governance\n6.1\nFor any guidance provided within the UoN Quality Manual, learners are advised that UoNO has the same standing and responsibilities as a School, wherever regulation is flagged as relevant.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n23 January 2024||"

Its contents are primarily directed at staff, but they may also be of interest to students at UoNO.Overview\nSchools intending to introduce a new credit bearing microcredential should first discuss their plans with UoNO. UoNO will decide whether to progress to the formal design phase. UoNO will advise Schools on the development process.\nIf this process is successful, then with the support of UoNO Schools may complete the New Credit bearing microcredential Information Template and submit it to Curriculum Leads in Registry and Academic Affairs. New Credit bearing micro-credentials will be approved by Curriculum Leads in Registry and Academic Affairs if they are in line with the requirements for credit bearing micro-credential specifications, otherwise they will be referred for consideration on behalf of Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) to the Curriculum Approvals and Advisory Team in Registry and Academic Affairs. If revisions are required, the form will be returned to UoNO and the School with guidance on how to proceed.\nSchools have a duty to consult with any other schools that are likely to have a legitimate interest in the creation of the credit bearing microcredential, e.g. if the subject matter of the new credit bearing micro-credential has any overlap with provision in another School.\nFor more information about creating a new microcredential, please consult the following:\nSubmission form for new microcredentials\nConditions for a new credit-bearing microcredential approval approval submission\nIn submitting a new credit bearing microcredential for approval, the following should be considered:\nThat, if relevant, the school indicates programme(s) of which the new credit bearing microcredential forms an integral part.\nAdditional information\nIncludes:\nRegistry and Academic Affairs; Campus Solutions; Curriculum Updating\nSchools will be provided with clear information about deadlines in advance of the curriculum updating cycle.\nModule information in Campus Solutions is used for relevant central processes and will be published in the Online Module Catalogue.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please email:\nss-curriculumadvice@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n23 January 2024||"

Its content is applicable to staff and students across China and Malaysia campuses only.1. Definition\nFor the purposes of this policy an academic appeal, as defined by the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA), is a \"request for a review of a decision of an academic body charged with making decisions on student progress, assessment and awards.\"\n2. Overview of the Academic Appeals procedure\nIncludes:\ncampus variations\nFor more information about the academic appeals procedure on each campus, please consult the following:\nAcademic Appeals Procedure: University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus\nAcademic Appeals Procedure: University of Nottingham Ningbo Campus\nThe following applies to UNNC and UNM only, for UNUK please see the following:\nStudent Academic Appeals Code of Practice\n3. Who can use the academic appeals procedure and the right to appeal?\nThe appeals procedure is available to students of the University of Nottingham, with the exception of students who have had their registration suspended by the University, other than at their own request under the voluntary interruption of studies procedure.\nFor more information about voluntary interruption of studies, please consult the following:\nVoluntary interruption of studies\n4. The right to appeal\nStudents have the right to appeal to the Academic Appeals Committee against the following final decisions of an academic body charged with making decisions on assessment, progression and awards:\n(a)\nThe conditions imposed and/or the requirement to take reassessments to progress to the next stage of a taught course or phase of research study.\n(b)\nA decision to terminate a student's current programme of study. This includes students whose programme of study is terminated but who are offered a transfer to another taught course or research degree.\n(c)\nA classification decision.\n1\nIn addition to appeals against the class of honours degree awarded, this also includes appeals against the classification of postgraduate awards and of other undergraduate awards.\n1\nA student who did not make the University aware of serious circumstances affecting their study before a progression Examination Board made its decision and who has met the progression requirements of the course, may appeal to be allowed further assessments in affected modules to mitigate a possible effect on their future degree classification. Such an appeal would be considered if submitted within one month of the marks confirming progression being published  and where the student demonstrates compelling reasons why they were unable to make the University aware of circumstances affecting their study prior to the Examination Board decision – for example, reasons associated with a disability, medically-evidenced incapacity to engage with support procedures.\n(d)\nA decision not to award the qualification for which a student is registered. This relates to decisions made at the end of a student's taught course or research degree; and includes appeals against decisions not to award any qualification or to award a lower qualification.\n(e)\nA decision of a University Fitness to Practise Committee or Practice Assessment Panel. This is relevant to students on professional courses who have been the subject of Fitness to Practise procedures. For more information, about Fitness to Practise procedures, please consult the following:\nFitness to practise procedures\n(f)\nThe outcome of an Extenuating Circumstances claim. For more information about extenuating circumstance procedures, please consult the following:\nExtenuating circumstances\n5. Grounds for appeals\n5.1\nIt is for the student to establish the case and only claims of at least one of the following circumstances will be considered as grounds for appeal:\n(i)\nThat parts of the documented assessment procedure were not applied and that this procedural irregularity, which has disadvantaged the student, was significant enough to have materially affected the decision or recommendation made, rendering it unsound.\n(ii)\nThat prejudice or bias on the part of one or more of the examiners took place and can be proven or there are grounds to support a reasonable perception of prejudice or bias.\n(iii)\nThat the decision making body took a decision which no reasonable person would find comprehensible. Disagreement with the decision does not make it manifestly unreasonable. To apply this ground the student must provide substantive argumentation as to why no reasonable person could have arrived at the decision that was made.\n(iv)\nThe student’s performance was materially affected by circumstances and there is new evidence of these circumstances which was not, and could not have been, made available to the Board of Examiners at the time of its original decision.\n5.2\nThe following circumstances will not be considered grounds for appeal:\n(a)\nPerceived shortcomings in tuition, supervision or support. Concerns relating to the quality of teaching or supervision, or other circumstances that relate to the delivery of a programme of study should be raised under the Policy on student complaints before the point of assessment or the submission of a thesis or dissertation. Cases where complaints are upheld and there has been a clear impact on an academic outcome may lead to an academic conclusion e.g. allowing a student a further attempt at an assessment.\nFor more information about the Policy on student complaints, please consult the following:\nPolicy on student complaints\n(b)\nMatters of academic judgement of a School Board of Examiners or individual. The student will not be permitted to argue the academic merits of their work. The student's assertion that the result unfairly reflects the merit of their work or their ability is not a ground of appeal.\n(c)\nDisagreement with the actual mark awarded for a piece of assessed work except where grounds can be established above. If a student wished to have clarification about a mark received for an individual assessment or module they are advised to contact their School or module convener directly. Errors in calculating or recording marks on the basis of which the original decision was made cannot be submitted as grounds for appeal, unless these errors have been brought to the School's attention but not accepted by the School.\n(d)\nAppeals against provisional marks.\n(e)\nAny matters relating to circumstances affecting study which could have been raised before the meeting of the Board of Examiners.\nPrinciples of the policy\nIncludes:\ntimescales; treatment of the appeal; advice from the Students' Union\nThe decisions made will be reasonable and, where required, provide appropriate redress.\nAppeals submitted outside the timescales prescribed in the procedure will only be considered in the most exceptional circumstances and where there is good reason, supported by evidence, for the late submission.\nAppeals will be treated seriously and students will not suffer any disadvantage or recrimination as the result of making an appeal in good faith.\nThe University Policy on Communications with Third Parties is applicable to this policy. It is expected that students or people communicating on behalf of a student will conduct themselves responsibly and treat the process and those members of the University involved in the process with respect at all times. Where behaviour falls outside these expectations, the University’s Unacceptable Behaviour Policy will apply. For more information about the Policy on Communications with Third Parties, please consult the following:\nPolicy on Communications with Third Parties\nThe University will not accept or investigate appeals which it considers to be in breach of the standards set out in the Unacceptable Behaviour Policy. For more information about the University's Unacceptable Behaviour Policy, please consult the following:\nUnacceptable Behaviour Policy\nThe procedures are fair and transparent.\nThe Complaints and Conduct Manager has executive oversight of the process.\nThe process is evidence-based.\nStudents are encouraged to seek advice from an Education Adviser in Students' Union advice or equivalent office University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) and University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC) at any stage in the process, including seeking advice on how to present their case effectively.\nAppeals form part of the University's process of quality review and improvement and are considered as providing valuable feedback rather than criticism. We will widely publicise information about procedures to students and staff, and all schools and central services are required to provide a link to them via their websites.\nStudents will be notified early in the process if the remedy sought within the appeal is beyond what the University can reasonably provide or what is in its power to provide.\nIt is important for students to note that the Office of the Independent Adjudicator cannot consider matters which are or which have been the subject of court proceedings. Similarly, the University reserves the right to decline, suspend or to discontinue an appeal made under the Academic Appeal Procedure, in the event that legal proceedings are commenced and the claim concerns the same subject matter as the appeal.\nRecording and monitoring of academic appeals\nIt is important that appeals are monitored in order to improve the student experience. The Complaints and Conduct Team will record and provide reports to indicate the nature of appeals and outcomes. Such reports will:\nFeed into the monitoring and evaluation procedure at various levels: department, school, faculty and University;\nFeed directly into appropriate University-wide committees;\nAssist in identifying problems and trends across the University;\nForm the basis of positive publicity, in demonstrating that identified issues have been resolved;\nBe made available to the Students' Union\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n23 September 2024||"

Policy\nIncludes:\nreceipt of information; formal notice; submission information\nEvery research student and those members of academic staff eligible to act as Internal or External Examiners will receive information on the University's procedures for assessing research degree submissions.\nA student wishing to submit a thesis for examination must give formal notice to Student Services, (School Registry Office at the University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) or the Graduate School for the University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC)) of the intention to submit (see the Documentation section for the form and Submission Pack).\nSubmission information pack for PGRs\nThe form can also be submitted to the candidate’s School for onward transmission to Student Services. Student Services, UNM School Registry or the Graduate School at UNNC will make arrangements for the nomination and appointment of Examiners (see the Documentation section) and, provided that the thesis has been submitted, will forward the thesis to the Examiners within one week of receiving the Examiners’ written agreement to act.\n2. Criteria for award of qualifications\nIncludes:\nframeworks; presentation of thesis; originality requirements\nResearch degrees will be awarded at Masters or Doctoral level to students who have demonstrated that they satisfy the relevant qualification descriptors contained in the University of Nottingham Qualifications Framework (UNQF). For more information about the UNQF, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\nThe thesis should be presented in a satisfactory manner. The subject matter must be clearly and precisely expressed, its arguments logical and intelligible, and its language appropriate. It must show that the student not only has ideas, but also has the ability to put them into suitable words.\nThe thesis must be written by the student and be the result of the student's own work. The requirement does not preclude a student obtaining limited assistance with the routine collection and/or processing of data under guidelines and instructions clearly devised by the student. When such help is obtained it should be with the prior approval of the supervisor who must be satisfied that the spirit of the 'own work' requirement is not breached. Students are encouraged to publish papers in advance of submission of their thesis and prior publication of papers arising from the research being undertaken should not prejudice the assessment of the thesis.\n3. Examiners' reports\nIncludes:\nsubmission; format; merits and shortcomings of a submission\nThe Examiners should submit independent reports on the submission to Registry and Academic Affairs, the Student Registry Office at UNM or the Graduate School at UNNC, or the Head of School before the viva voce examination takes place.\nThe reports need not be provided in a standard format but must be written in English and word-processed or typed and must include the name and School of the student, the degree sought, the signature, name (printed), position of the Examiner (i.e Internal or External) and the date. They should contain a full and frank assessment of the merits and weaknesses of the thesis in the light of the criteria described above. It is suggested that a favourable report should normally fill at least one side of A4 paper.\nIt is particularly important that the merits and shortcomings of a submission are provided in full and in detail if the report is unfavourable and, therefore, a lengthier report might be expected. It should be noted that Examiners' Independent and Joint reports will be given to the candidate when the examination outcome is notified and circulated to staff and students as part of the University's Appeals procedures if relevant.\n4. Feedback to candidate and examiners' report\nIncludes:\nviva voce examination; formal written correspondence\nFollowing a viva voce examination, the student should be given immediate informal feedback on the outcome of the examination and should be advised that more formal details will be transmitted later in writing.\nThe Internal Examiner should also write to the student formally conveying the joint views of the Examiners on the submission, describing in detail the academic and presentational reasons for their recommendation, and, if appropriate, providing clear advice about what matters should be addressed in any resubmission.\nFor more information about viva voce examinations, please consult the following:\nViva voce examinations\n5. Approval of examiners' report\nIncludes:\njoint report form; role of Student Services\nThe Joint Report Form shall be forwarded by the Examiners to the Head of School for approval and  signature and they shall forward the Independent and Joint Report Forms to Student Services for approval by the University.\n*NB the same procedure shall be followed with respect to students who submit their theses for examination at UNM or UNNC. The Student Registry or Graduate School should also receive copies of the Examiners' reports (including Head of School's signature) for information only. Staff in Student Services shall be responsible for ensuring that staff at UNM or UNNC are kept informed of the University's decision concerning such submissions.\nStudent Services will write to the student within one week of the University's decision being made, informing them of the recommendation that the degree be awarded (or not) and advising them of the procedures for graduating, or for lodging an appeal, as appropriate.\nKey documentation\nIncludes: Information for Examiners, supervisors and candidates; guidance on submission by published works; submission pack for candidates; notification of submission of thesis guidance\nInformation for examiners, supervisors and candidates for the degree of MPhil and other research degrees at Masters Level\nInformation for examiners, supervisors and candidates for the degree of PhD, EdD, DM and other qualifications at doctoral level\nSubmission for research degree by published works\nSubmission information pack for PGRs\nNotification of submission of thesis for examination of a research degree\nNotification of submission of thesis for examination of a research degree\nNotification of submission of thesis for examination of a research degree\nAdditional guidance in 2020/21 due to Covid-19\nPlease be aware that the following guidance was developed and applied during academic year 2020/21 in response to the coronavirus pandemic, and should be read in conjunction with all other content on this page:\nSubmission Pack for Candidates (during Covid-19)\nCovid-19 and doctoral examinations – additional guidance for examiners for doctoral candidates at the University of Nottingham\nThe active application of these arrangements then ceased at the beginning of academic year 2021/22. Any outcomes from their previous application will, however, continue to be honoured and used in all decisions regarding those affected.\nFor more information about the Exceptional Regulations as a whole, please consult the following:\nExceptional Regulations: Covid-19 - 2019/20 - 2020/21\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nGraduate School - PGR\nGS-PGR@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n06 February 2025||"

        "content": "Policy on e-exams - The University of NottinghamPolicy on e-exams\nThis page contains the University's policy on e-exams, including an outline of its minimum expectations. Its content is applicable to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.This represents an interim arrangement for academic year 2022-23 as the University prepares for the introduction of a new e-exams platform as part of the Curriculum Management and e-Assessment project. For 2022-23, campuses at University of Nottingham in Malaysia (UNM) and University of Nottingham in Ningbo, China (UNNC) may operate a different approach to e-exams depending on their local circumstances and operations.\n1. Overview\nIncludes:\ndefinition;\nexpectations; staff and School requirements; technical failure; student access\n1.1\nBy electronic exams (e-exams) we mean summative assessments set in Moodle (including via Turnitin) or ExamSys for a whole module cohort of a duration of 24 hours or less. These may be assessments set during the University’s formal assessment or reassessment periods, and also includes assessments that are classified as ‘exams’ in Campus Solutions but take place outside of the University’s designated exam periods.\nThis policy focuses on summative e-exams, so formative e-exams, such as formative class tests run during teaching periods, are not covered by this policy.   Additionally, other modes of summative e-exam, such as presentations or language oral exams, which are typically arranged on a one-to-one basis, are not covered by this policy; they would be considered an ‘exam’ (not e-exam) under Quality Manual regulations, whether undertaken in person or remotely (e.g. on Teams).\nE-exams are therefore treated categorically as ‘exams’, and are separate from the rules governing ‘coursework’. For ExamSys (formerly Rogo) assessments, this includes both exams taken remotely, and exams taken under invigilated conditions on campus.\n1.2\nSummative e-exams (as defined above) should only be set using ExamSys, Moodle Assignments or Turnitin. Other e-exam platforms are not supported by the University and should not be used for summative exams (with the exception of certain specialist subject assessment tools already approved for use in certain areas).\n1.3\nThe e-exams policy outlines the minimum requirements that the University expects to be met when delivering summative assessment electronically. The requirements of the policy are in addition to normal University policies, procedures and regulations relating to assessment, which will apply unless otherwise stated.\n1.4\nModule conveners should ensure that approval from their School Teaching and Learning Committee (or equivalent) is obtained before e-exam is used as a tool for summative assessment.\n1.5\nAll staff members involved in the e-exam process must be familiar with the on-line environment and have attended the appropriate University training course prior to gaining access to the system.\n1.6\nSchools must ensure that e-exam is fit for purpose and does not compromise the assessment methodology and the integrity of what is being assessed.\n1.7\nComprehensive University-wide plans should be in place to manage every aspect of the e-exam procedure ensuring that the process is robust, reliable, fair and efficient and that robust contingency plans are in place to mitigate against technical failure.\n1.8\nFor ExamSys (formerly Rogo) e-exams invigilated on campus, where technical failure occurs within the first 75% of the time over which the examination is scheduled, the examination may be rescheduled and/or may be offered in paper form (if appropriate). If failure should occur within the last 25% of the time over which the examination is scheduled, the examination will be abandoned and marks gained may, at the discretion of the exam board, be scaled accordingly.\n1.9\nStudents must be given access to, and be familiar with, the examination format, question types and the technology prior to the summative e-exam.\n2. Roles and responsibilities\nIncludes:\nroles and responsibilities\n2.1\nSchools wishing to use e-exams should ensure that they comply with the appropriate procedures and policies which include the roles and responsibilities of staff, both within and outside of the School, who are involved in the e-exam process. Schools are responsible for the academic aspect of the e-exam.\n2.2\nRegistry and Academic Affairs (RAA) will be responsible for the practical arrangements for all summative examinations - this includes scheduling, room booking and invigilation.\n2.3\nRAA will be responsible for establishing a schedule of exams, setting up submission boxes on Moodle, arranging additional time for students with support plans, and communicating the schedule to students and staff.\n2.4\nDTS are responsible for the technical infrastructure, which enables assessment to occur including technical support during e-exams.\n2.5\nRAA colleagues will release all e-exam papers on Moodle at the designated times. Appropriate review of pressure points in the timetable will be undertaken by RAA colleagues prior to the exam periods and targeted interventions made to minimise the risk to Moodle.  Module conveners will be contacted separately where this is the case. Also, communications on what to expect and how to manage periods of slow function or interruption will be distributed to staff and students ahead of the exam period and via prominent messaging on Moodle.\n2.6\nModule convenors should continue to provide details of what students should expect from all e-exams including the structure of the paper, the material it covers, and how to revise effectively.  Module conveners are responsible for uploading ExamSys e-exams. Once the paper has been uploaded, module convenors are not permitted to answer any questions from students about the paper. Any corrective actions in the event of a question error will be considered during the moderation and marks adjustment processes.\nFor more information about moderation and marks adjustment processes, please consult the following:\nPolicy on marking and grading\n2.7\nSchools and Departments are recommended to make all students aware of the Essential Guidance for Students on Academic Integrity in Online Examinations. It is recommended that links to this document are also included in the submission box created by RAA colleagues for the e-exams.\nFor more information about Essential Guidance for Students on Academic Integrity in Online Examinations, please consult the following:\nThe Academic Misconduct Procedure\n3. Assessment design and delivery\nIncludes:\nintegrity of the examination process; duration of e-exams; extra time for students with support plans; External Examiners\n3.1\nAll e-exams in Moodle longer than 3 hours should be set with a duration of 24 hours. E-exams in Moodle with a duration of up to 3 hours are known as ‘short timed exams’ (STEs) and can be scheduled for 1, 2 or 3 hours. Assessments with a duration of longer than 24 hours are classified as ‘coursework’ and should not normally have deadlines set during designated exam periods, except where student cohorts are unlikely to be sitting significant numbers of exams.\n3.2\nFor e-exams in Moodle of 24 hours, students should be clearly informed that they are not expected to work continuously during the 24-hour assessment window. An indication of active working time (an appropriate number of hours for students to spend on these exams) should be signposted in the rubric on the front of the exam paper: this should not normally be more than 3 hours. Students with extensions due to support plans should also be advised how to approach their assessment windows and active working time within them.\n3.3\nE-exams using ExamSys will routinely be set during a single working day.  In line with current practice, any duration, not normally exceeding 3 hours, is permitted.\n3.4\nUpload time windows and late submission are covered in the ‘Assessment Regulations’ section of the Quality Manual.\nFor more information about upload time windows and late submissions, please consult the following:\nAssessment regulations\n3.5\nFor e-exams, students with support plans will be given 50% additional time, with the exception of students who require more than 50% additional time. This 50% extension already includes adjustments such as reading time and rest breaks.  i.e. including additional upload times, this is 2 hours 15 minutes for a one hour e-exam, 3 hours 45 minutes for 2 hour e-exams, and 5 hours 15 minutes for 3 hour e-exams.\n3.6\nFor 24-hour e-exams, students with support plans requiring 50% extra time will have an additional five working hours, so submission will fall within the same working day. Students who require more than 50% extra time may be asked to submit their work on the following day.\n3.7\nThe University will explore what provision might be made for accommodating students with disabilities to sit their e-exams on campus, particularly where a scribe is required.\n3.8\nIf Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Bodies (PSRBs) require a different approach to support plan accommodations that deviate from this policy, permission should be sought, via RAA, under the QSC procedure for cases outside of regulations.\n3.9\nThe academic processes surrounding the compilation of e-exams should be the same as those for other forms of assessment but, in addition:\ni.)   External Examiners should have knowledge of e-exams and be provided with appropriate training to allow for effective interaction with the University’s software\nii.)   In order to fulfil their responsibilities, External Examiners should be granted access to the e-exam software to review examination papers and student scripts in the format in which they are to be delivered. External Examiners should also be made aware of the checks that are put in place to ensure that academic misconduct does not occur.\niii.)   External Examiners should approve the base design of the e-exam as well as the checks that are put in place to ensure that academic misconduct does not occur.\n3.10\nIn accordance with standard University procedure all questions should be peer reviewed.\nFor more information about the role of External Examiners, please consult the following:\nAppointment and responsibilities of External Examiners\n3.11\nIn order to protect the integrity of the examinations process, it will only be possible for students to take campus-based invigilated summative e-exams away from designated University examination venues where appropriate checks are put in place to ensure that academic misconduct does not occur.  Schools should exercise academic judgement in determining what is appropriate within their subject areas and modes of assessment.  Before seeking to implement any such approach, Schools much check the technical and logistical viability of their approach with DTS and RAA.\n3.12\nRequests to vary the University Assessment Regulations to accommodate e-exams should be made to, and approved by, Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) before the assessment is set. For example, it is recognised that in some cases PSRB requirements may require deviation from the regulations outlined above, and these should be sought, via RAA, under the QSC procedure for cases outside of regulations.\nFor more information about the QSC procedure for cases outside of regulations, please consult the following:\nQuality and Standards Committee\n4. Scheduling of e-exam\nIncludes:\nresponsibilities\n4.1\nRAA will normally be responsible for scheduling all summative e-exams. If, however, the e-exams occurs outside the main exam periods, it is the School’s responsibility to ensure that any requested time slot avoids timetable conflicts for students. Schools should also be mindful of availability of computer rooms outside of the main exam period when they are being used for teaching activity.\n4.2\nIt is the responsibility of Schools to adhere to the published timelines for summative examinations. If the published deadlines dates cannot be met it will be the responsibility of the School to support these examinations in-house.\n4.3\nIt is the responsibility of Schools to ensure the suitability of checks to ensure that academic misconduct does not occur.\n4.4\nFor STEs in Moodle and ExamSys, students will be clearly informed about release times. These will usually be 9am or 1.30pm, but may be 4.30pm or, if needed to protect system performance, release times could be released 15-30 minutes later than these times.\n4.5\nFor 24-hour e-exams, these will usually be released at 9am (Monday to Friday). The submission time will be set on Moodle at the same time on the following working day (Tuesday to Saturday).\n4.6\nRAA will aim to create an exam timetable which avoids more than two STE exams timetabled in the same day. Students may find that they have two overlapping 24-hour exams, or a short-timed exam overlapping with a 24-hour exam, and these should be treated in the same way as two STEs, since the assessment windows will allow active working time for two assessments within the same working day.\n4.7\nIf a student has a support plan and has a 24-hour exam with a deadline on the same day as another 24-hour exam, or on the same day as an STE, one additional working day will be permitted to complete that 24-hour exam. Therefore if the normal deadline is 09.00 on a Friday, the student’s deadline will already have been extended to 14.00 that same day due to a support plan, and if the student has multiple deadlines that day, their new deadline will be 14.00 on the Saturday. No further extensions can be granted, even if that student has another deadline on the Saturday.\n4.8\nAll exams will be set according to UK time (BST/GMT) when Digital Technology Services (DTS) will be available (Learning Technologies will supplement with out-of-hours support where necessary).\n5. Assessment of students\nIncludes:\nresponsibility of the School; information provided to students; checking the accuracy of system generated marks\n5.1\nThe School is responsible for ensuring that students are aware of contingency arrangements to cover technical failure on the day of a scheduled e-exam.\n5.2\nIt is the responsibility of the School to approve all marking schemes which may include negative marking or compensation for baseline guess. Details of how these marking schemes are applied must be made clear to the students before the e-exam.\n5.3\nComprehensive programme and/or module information must be provided to students which should include details of all e-exam requirements included marking criteria.\n5.4\nStudents sitting e-exams for summative purposes must be given an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the software before formal e-exam takes place.\n5.5\nSchool procedures should include systems for checking accuracy of system generated marks, the accurate recording of these marks within the student record system and protocols for the amendment/removal of flawed questions in line with the moderation and marks adjustment processes.\nFor more information about moderation and marks adjustment processes, please consult the following:\nPolicy on marking and grading\n6. Invigilation\n6.1\nInvigilation for centrally scheduled examinations will be through normal University procedures.\n6.2\nRAA will be responsible for ensuring that invigilation arrangements are appropriate for the medium of delivery.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n22 October 2024||"

This selection should be undertaken in consultation with their academic tutors and shall be subject to the approval of their Head of School. A School offering a module has the right to refuse admission to that module.\nFor more information about the University's Qualifications Framework, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\n3.\nIn making their selection of modules, students must satisfy any prerequisites, corequisites or other requirements set out in the relevant module or programme specification.\n4.\nStudents may not select taught modules worth more than 80 credits in any one semester.\n5.\nThe work presented for assessment for an award of a taught postgraduate qualification must be the result of work done mainly while the candidate is registered as a student of this University.\nAward of credit\nIncludes:\npass mark; components; failure to pass; Recognition of Other Learning (ROL)\n6.\nThe pass mark for a module comprising part of a Masters, Postgraduate Diploma or Postgraduate Certificate programme is 50%.\n7.\nThe module specification states how the components of the module will be combined to form a module mark and whether a particular mark must be gained in individual components of the module in order for the module as a whole to be passed. A student who passes the module will be awarded the credit for that module.\n8.\nA student who fails to pass a module may nevertheless be awarded the credit for that module in the circumstances set out in Regulations 10 and 11 (in the Completion of a stage section) below.\n9.\nCredit may also be awarded under the University’s policy on Recognition of Other Learning (formerly known as Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL)). For more information, please consult the following:\nRecognition of Other Learning\nCompletion of a stage\nIncludes:\nfailure of one or more modules; progression requirements\n10.\nStudents will normally proceed directly from the taught stage of their course to the dissertation/project stage. Where a student is undertaking assessment in August/September, they may request a deferral of the dissertation/project stage enabling them to undertake this in the next academic year. Where Schools require students to pass pre-requisite modules or demonstrate achievement of learning outcomes before proceeding to the dissertation stage, this will be explicitly stated in the relevant programme specification.\n11.\nA student who fails one or more modules for the taught stage of the course will still complete that stage and so be awarded the total credit for that stage provided that:\nThey have passed modules worth at least two-thirds of credits, and\nThey have a weighted average for the taught stage of at least 50% with no module marks of less than 40%\nNotwithstanding the above, module marks below 40% for up to 20 credits will be compensated if the student has passed modules worth at least 80 credits and has a weighted average of at least 50%.\n12.\nA course may only have progression requirements more stringent than those stated in Regulation 11 above if there is a demonstrable requirement from a professional or accrediting external body. Students who fail to satisfy the requirements of such a course but who nonetheless satisfy the progression criteria as stated in Regulations 10 and 11 will be eligible for the award of a named non-accredited degree.\n13.\nRegulation 11 will not apply to any module which is listed in the relevant programme specification as not compensatable. A student who fails such a module will not complete that stage without successfully undertaking re-assessment in that module. The Masters dissertation/project stage will always be non-compensatable.\nRe-assessment\nIncludes:\nstudent rights; potential scenarios; further re-assessment\n14.\nA student who, at the first attempt, has not satisfactorily completed the taught stage or dissertation/project stage of the course has a right to one reassessment in each failed module where this might enable a student to satisfy programme requirements. All reassessments will take place in August/September immediately following the first assessment, except:\nWhere a School agrees to a written request from the student to take the reassessment at a later date (such requests must be made before the August/September reassessment period);\nWhere a School arranges an earlier reassessment;\nWhere this is not possible owing to external constraints;\nWhere different arrangements are made for distance learning or part-time students.\nThe form of the reassessment will be the same as for the first attempt for taught modules unless stated otherwise in the module specification. The full marks gained on re-assessment will be used for determining whether compensation can occur under the provision of Regulation 11 (in the Completion of a stage section) above.\n15.\nWhere a student has pass marks in one or more components of the module, but has failed the module overall, the School delivering the module may limit the re-assessment to the components which have been failed. The re-assessment mark for the module will then be a combination (on the same basis as in Regulation 7 of the Award of credit section above) of the marks from the components passed first time and the components which have been re-assessed.\n16.\nA student may request to be allowed to repeat their enrolment in failed modules (which will include attendance at all scheduled classes and submission of all coursework) before taking the re-assessments. Requests should be submitted to the student’s School who must consult other relevant Schools when making the decision. A School should (if possible) agree to such a request, but there may be circumstances where this is not possible (e.g. where the module is no longer running). If a student opts to take any one reassessment with attendance, they must then take all due reassessments with attendance (except for modules where a repeat enrolment is not available).\nA module specification may stipulate that, in order for a student to be re-assessed in a particular module, the student must repeat their enrolment in that module. In such circumstances, the student will not be compelled to take all reassessments in attendance and may take all other reassessments either in August/September or during the session when they are attending for the purpose of the module(s) that require attendance.\n17.\nStudents may not be re-assessed in modules they have already passed.\n18.\nA student who, after re-assessment, has not passed assessments as specified in these regulations and the relevant programme specification may be permitted one further re-assessment in up to one-third of taught stage credits provided:\n(a)\nA mark of at least 40% has been obtained in either first or second sitting, and\n(b)\nThe student has an overall credit-weighted average of 50%.\nIf, after this one further re-assessment, the student has still not passed assessments as specified in these regulations and the relevant programme specification, they will have no further re-assessment opportunities.\nAwards\nIncludes:\nrequirements; Postgraduate Diplomas or Certificates\n19.\nA student will only receive a Masters award if they have successfully completed both the taught and dissertation/project stages of their course. A student who does not successfully complete the dissertation/project stage will be awarded a Postgraduate Diploma or Certificate if they have gained a pass mark of 50% or more in modules worth 120 credits (60 credits for the Postgraduate Certificate), or satisfy the requirements of Regulations 10 and 11 (of the Completion of a stage section) above unless Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Body (PSRB) or local government regulations preclude this. For the purposes of the award of the Postgraduate Diploma the dissertation mark will count. Students on a 2 year taught masters programme who achieve 180 credits may also be eligible for a Masters award, whether a named fallback award specified in the programme specification or, where such does not exist, the generic Master of Combined Studies, subject to meeting the criteria for those awards.\n20.\nPostgraduate Diplomas or Certificates awarded under Regulation 19 above will have the same subject title as the Masters course on which the student was registered, unless the programme specification states an alternative subject title for those being awarded Diplomas or Certificates.\n21.\nThe provisions of Regulations 19 and 20 above also apply to the award of Postgraduate Certificates to students registered on a Postgraduate Diploma course.\nClassification\nIncludes:\nre-assessment contributions; extenuating circumstances; borderlines; variation\n22.\nPostgraduate Masters, Diploma and Certificates will be awarded with Merit to students who achieve a final credit-weighted mark of at least 60% and with Distinction to students who achieve a final credit-weighted mark of at least 70%.\n23.\nMarks awarded on re-assessment do not contribute to the final mark for the purpose of awarding Merits and Distinctions in Regulation 22 above; instead the mark gained on the first attempt at the module will be used. Marks awarded on re-assessment will, however, count towards attaining a Pass in the course overall.\n24.\nNormally the degree classification awarded is determined entirely by the final average mark (weighted by credits and year of study as defined in the programme specifications) according to the model in the Degree Classification section of the Quality Manual.\nFor more information about this model, please consult the following:\nDegree classification\nThere are, however two situations in which further considerations come into play.\n(a)\nWhere the final mark falls within a borderline (as defined in the Degree Classification section of the Quality Manual). In such a case the Examiners will apply the University's standardised algorithm (as described in the APAR section of the Quality Manual) to determine whether the classification may be raised to the next higher classification. In considering the fraction of credits at the higher level, all modules are to be counted even those that have been excluded from the calculation of the final average under 24(b).\n(b)\nWhere the student has approved extenuating circumstances claims satisfying each of the following. The claims\ni)\nAre for modules attracting no more than 20 credits\nii)\nAre in the final stage/year for which a further attempt at the assessment has not been possible by the time of the Examination Board’s meeting.\nIn this situation, marks from those modules only may be excluded from the calculation of the final average provided that:\ni)\nMarks from all such affected modules are discounted;\nii)\nAll non-compensatable modules have been passed;\niii)\nThe Extenuating Circumstances panel can clearly demonstrate that the final mark after the exclusion is more representative of the student’s normal performance (normally by showing that the excluded module marks are significantly anomalous);\nStudents may decline the application of regulation 24(b) and opt to undertake a further attempt at the affected assessments, but will not graduate until they have completed those reassessments.\nAll instances in which such exclusions are applied should be communicated to Student Services Development (Academic Processes) for report to Quality and Standards Committee (QSC). Reports should be submitted at the same time as the main Examination Board recommendations in November (Taught Postgraduate programmes).\nFor more information, please email:\nStudent Services Development (Academic Processes)\nFrom September 2020 all students are subject to Regulation 24(b) from the 2020/21 regulations, which can be found here:\nRegulations from September 2020\n25.\nThere is no discretion to lower the classification below that indicated by the final mark.\n26.\nAny of the above regulations may be varied as stated in the relevant programme specification where an exception has been formally approved.  If such a variation is applied and results in the termination of a student's registration on that programme, the student must be offered the opportunity to transfer to a non-accredited programme providing that they satisfy the above regulations. Notwithstanding the above, where no suitable non-accredited programme can exist or where local government requirements prohibit the award of a different qualification from that which the student was studying, students will receive the relevant non-accredited qualification equivalent to the number of credits they have already accrued unless local requirements prohibit fallback awards.

Students who entered Qualifying year or Part I before September 2019 are subject to former regulations.\nFor more information about the former regulations, please consult the following section:\nUndergraduate study regulations\nSupplementary and Fitness to practise Regulations\nIn addition to the study regulations which are stated on this page, students will be subject to the supplementary regulations for their individual courses, which can be found at:\nCurriculum Catalogue\nIn addition, some programmes will be subject to Fitness to Practise regulations, details of which are included in relevant course handbooks.\nAssessment Regulations\nAssessment regulations can be found on the following page:\nAssessment and marking policies\nExtenuating circumstances\nGuidance on managing students with extenuating circumstances can be found on the following:\nExtenuating circumstances\nContact details\nStudents seeking advice on these regulations should contact their School/Department.\nSchools can obtain guidance on these regulations by emailing:\nug-regulations@nottingham.ac.uk\n.\nApproved courses of study\nIncludes:\nqualification requirements; module selection; credit limits\n1.\nTo qualify for an award a student must:\n(a)\nPursue an approved course of study as prescribed by a programme specification.\n(b)\nPass the assessments specified in these Regulations and in the relevant programme specification.\n(c)\nSuccessfully complete any additional components that are required as specified in the relevant programme specification.\n2.\nStudents must select their modules in accordance with the relevant programme specification and the University’s Qualifications Framework. This selection should be undertaken in consultation with their academic tutors and shall be subject to the approval of their School. A School offering a module has the right to refuse admission to that module.\nFor more information about the University's Qualification Framework, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\n3.\nIn making their selection of modules, students must satisfy any prerequisites, corequisites or other requirements set out in the relevant module or programme specification.\n4.\nStudents may not select modules worth more than 70 credits in any one semester.\nAward of credit\nIncludes:\npass mark; components; failure to pass; Recognition of Other Learning (ROL)\n5.\nThe pass mark for a module is 40%. In order to pass a module and be awarded the credit for that module a student must also satisfy any requirements as specified in paragraph 6.\n6.\nThe module specification states how the components of the module will be combined to form a module mark and whether a particular mark must be gained in individual components of the module in order for the module as a whole to be passed.\n7.\nA student who fails to pass a module may nevertheless be awarded the credit for that module in the circumstances set out in Regulations 10 and 11 (within the Completion of a stage section).\n8.\nCredit may also be awarded under the University’s policy on Recognition of Other Learning (ROL)(formerly known as Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL)). For more information, please consult the following:\nRecognition of Other Learning\nCompletion of a stage\nIncludes:\nfailure of one or more modules; progression requirements\n9.\nA student who passes all the modules in a given stage of their course (as defined in the University’s Qualifications Framework) will complete that stage and be awarded the total credit for that stage. A student who completes the requirements for a Foundation Certificate or qualifies for an Honours level or Integrated Masters degree through application of the relevant degree classification model and weightings (see Regulations 22 and 23 of the Classification section) will automatically complete the final stage of their course and be awarded the total credit for that stage, unless the relevant programme specification contains additional requirements for completion of the final stage. For more information about the University's Qualifications Framework, please consult the following page:\nQualification types and structures\n10.\nA student who fails one or more modules will still complete that stage (subject to Regulation 11 below), and so be awarded the total credit for that stage provided that they have:\n(a)\nPassed modules worth at least 80 credits and have a weighted average for the stage of at least 40% with no module marks of less than 30%\nor\n(b)\nPassed modules worth at least 100 credits and have a weighted average for the stage of at least 50%\nor\n(c)\nPassed modules worth at least 90 credits, have marks of 30% or more in modules worth at least 110 credits, and have a weighted average for the stage of at least 45%\n.\n11.\nRegulation 10 does not apply to the final stage of any degree programme nor to any module which is listed in the relevant programme specification as not compensatable. A student who fails a non-compensatable module will not complete that stage without successfully undertaking re-assessment in that module.\n12.\nStudents registered on the following types of programmes may be required by the relevant programme specification to attain higher marks in individual specified modules and/or higher average marks than indicated in paragraphs 9 and 10 above.\n(i)\nAn Integrated Masters programme\n(ii)\nCertain Honours programmes with a compulsory period away from the University.\nStudents in categories (i) and (ii) above who fail to satisfy the requirements of such a programme but who nonetheless satisfy the criteria as stated in Regulations 9 or 10 will be eligible to transfer to an alternative course, where one exists, as stated in the Supplementary Regulations.\n(iii)\nThe Foundation Stage of any programme\nStudents in category (iii) above who fail to meet the specified requirement may be unable to progress but subject to satisfying Regulation 9 above will be awarded the Foundation Certificate.\nReassessment\nIncludes:\nstudent rights; potential scenarios; progression requirements and options\n13.\nA student who, at the first attempt, has not satisfactorily completed a stage other than the final stage under Regulations 9-11 (of the Completion of a stage section above) has a right to one re-assessment in each failed module where this might enable a student to satisfy progression requirements. The form of the re-assessment will be the same as for the first attempt unless stated otherwise in the module specification. Reassessment marks are considered only in decisions relating to progression to the next stage hence reassessments in the final stage of any programme are not relevant or allowed except in the case of reassessment for a Pass or Ordinary degree or where a student has failed a non-compensatable module and is required to take a reassessment in order to gain the credits and complete the stage.\n14.\nWhere a student has pass marks in one or more components of the module, but has failed the module overall, the School delivering the module may limit the re-assessment to the components which have been failed. The re-assessment mark for the module will then be a combination (on the same basis as in Regulation 6 of the Award of credit section above) of the marks from the components passed first time and the components which have been re-assessed.\n15.\nAll re-assessments must be undertaken before the student progresses to the next stage (but see Regulation 20 below). All reassessments will take place in August/September immediately following the first assessment (but see Regulations 16 and 20 below), except:\nWhere a School agrees to a written request from the student to take the reassessment at a later date (such requests must be made before the August/September reassessment period);\nWhere a School arranges an earlier reassessment;\nWhere this is not possible owing to external constraints;\nWhere different arrangements are made for distance learning or part-time students.\nCircumstances where an exemption to Regulation 20 apply when the reassessment will normally take place at the next available scheduled opportunity in the academic year.\n16.\nA student may request to be allowed to repeat their enrolment in failed or incomplete modules (which will include attendance at all scheduled classes and submission of all coursework) before taking the reassessment or initial assessments. Requests should be submitted to the student’s School who must consult other relevant Schools, and, where the student is on a Tier 4 visa, the Visa and Immigration team, when making the decision. A School should (if possible) agree to such a request, but there may be circumstances where this is not possible (e.g. where the module is no longer running or where there are Tier 4 limitations on immigration sponsorship). If a student opts to take any one reassessment with attendance, they must then take all due reassessments with attendance (except for modules where a repeat enrolment is not available).\nA module specification may stipulate that in order for a student to be reassessed in that module, the student must repeat their enrolment. In such circumstances, the student will not be compelled to take all reassessments in attendance and may take all other reassessments either in August/September or during the session when they are attending for the purpose of the module(s) that require attendance.\n17.\nStudents may not be re-assessed in modules they have already passed.\n18.\nA student who, after re-assessment, has not completed the stage under Regulations 9-11 (of the Completion of a stage section above) will not be permitted to progress further on that course and will have no further re-assessment opportunities, except in the circumstances set out in Regulation 19 below.\n19.\nA student who, after re-assessment, has not completed the stage under Regulations 9-11 (of the Completion of a stage section above) but:\n(a)\nhas passed at least 80 credits of modules in the stage, and\n(b)\nhas an average of at least 40% across all modules in the stage will be permitted one further re-assessment in the failed modules at the next available opportunity.\nIf, after this one further re-assessment, the student has still not completed the stage under Regulations 9-11 (of the Completion of a stage section above), the student will not be permitted to progress further on the course and will have no further re-assessment opportunities.\n20.\nWhere a student is permitted to be reassessed under Regulation 13, 16 or 19, and has failed in modules worth no more than 20 credits, they may choose to proceed to the next stage of their programme but cannot be regarded as having completed that stage until the previous stage has been successfully completed.\nThere may be circumstances in which a student is unable to proceed carrying credits, for example:\n2+2 programme students coming from China and Malaysia - where the Home Office would not issue a visa unless the student has progressed\nCases where it is essential for a student to have passed (as opposed to have taken) a pre-requisite module before starting the next part of their programme\nProgression from a Foundation programme to an Honours degree\nIn those circumstances, Schools are required to have an approved Exemption from the regulation and to ensure that students are made aware of this exemption in the relevant Programme Specification. Students will not be permitted to carry 20 credits of fail and will need to have successfully passed at resit before progressing further on their programme.\nAwards\nIncludes:\nconditions of receipt; University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM)\n21.\nA student will only receive an award if they have successfully completed each necessary stage of the course leading to that award. Notwithstanding this provision, a student who has successfully completed the Qualifying and Part I stages of an Honours course and does not proceed will be awarded an Undergraduate Diploma. Equally, a student who has successfully completed the Qualifying Stage of an Honours course and does not proceed will be awarded an Undergraduate Certificate.\n* University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM)\nOwing to the requirements of the Malaysia Qualifications Agency (MQA), the option to award an Undergraduate Diploma or Undergraduate Certificate to students who do not proceed at University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) is not available.\nClassification\nIncludes:\ntable of degree classifications and abbreviations; marks contribution; borderline cases;  extenuating circumstances\n22.\nThe classifications and abbreviations for Honours degrees and Integrated Masters degrees are:\nTable of degree classifications and abbreviations\nClassification\nAbbreviation\nFirst Class\nI\nSecond Class, Division One\nII-1\nSecond Class, Division Two\nII-2\nThird Class\nIII\nThe degree classification model set out in the Quality Manual specifies the final mark ranges which apply to each class and how these are calculated and make provision for a student successfully completing an Honours degree course after reassessment to receive a Pass degree without an Honours classification. Programme Specifications state is used for each course.\nFor more information about degree classification, please consult the following section:\nDegree classification\n23.\nOrdinary degrees, Graduate Diplomas, Graduate Certificates, Undergraduate Diplomas, Undergraduate Certificates, and Foundation Certificates may be awarded with Merit or Distinction. The mark ranges which apply for these awards may be found here:\nAssessment and marking policies\n24.\nMarks awarded for modules in the foundation or qualifying stage do not contribute to the final mark calculation except in the case of Foundation Certificates and Undergraduate Certificates. Marks awarded on reassessment do not contribute to the final mark calculation in the case of Honours and Integrated Masters degrees and for the purpose of awarding Merits and Distinctions in Regulation 23 above.\n25.\nThe stage marks will be combined to calculate the final mark according to weightings which are given in the Programme Specification. The permitted weightings are defined on the following page:\nProgramme specification guidance\n26.\nNormally the degree classification awarded is determined entirely by the final average mark (weighted by credits and year of study as defined in the programme specifications) according to the model in the Degree Classification section of the Quality Manual. There are, however, two situations in which further considerations come into play.\n(a)\nWhere the final mark falls within a borderline (as defined in the Degree Classification section of the Quality Manual). In such a case the Examiners will apply the University's standardised algorithm to determine whether the classification may be raised to the next higher classification. In considering the fraction of credits at the higher level, all modules are to be counted even those that have been excluded from the calculation of the final average under 26(b).\n(b)\nWhere the student has approved extenuating circumstances claims satisfying each of the following. The claims\ni)\nAre for modules attracting no more than 20 credits\nii)\nAre in the final stage/year for which a further attempt at the assessment has not been possible by the time of the Examination Board’s meeting.\nIn this situation, marks from those modules only may be excluded from the calculation of the final average provided that:\ni)\nMarks from all such affected modules are discounted;\nii)\nAll non-compensatable modules have been passed;\niii)\nThe Extenuating Circumstances panel can clearly demonstrate that the final mark after the exclusion is more representative of the student’s normal performance (normally by showing that the excluded module marks are significantly anomalous);\nFor more information about degree classification, please consult the following section:\nDegree classification\nStudents may decline the application of regulation 26(b) and opt to undertake a further attempt at the affected assessments, but will not graduate until they have completed those reassessments.\nAll instances in which such exclusions are applied should be communicated to Student Services Development (Academic Processes) for report to Quality and Standards Committee (QSC). Reports should be submitted at the same time as the main Examination Board recommendations in June/July (Undergraduate programmes).\nPlease send your communications to:\nSS-qsc-cases@exmail.nottingham.ac.uk\nWhen a student has experienced circumstances affecting their ability to study/take assessments in their final year of study, Examination Boards may recommend that a case be made to QSC to revisit performance in earlier years for the purposes of recommending a degree classification outside regulations. This recommendation should only be used in exceptional circumstances for cases where there is no prospect of the student undertaking first attempts within a reasonable period of time, for example, in the case of chronic or terminal illness of the student or the dependent of a student.\nFrom September 2020 all students are subject to Regulation 26(b) from the 2020/21 regulations, which can be found here:\nRegulations from September 2020\n27.\nThere is no discretion to lower the classification below that indicated by the final mark.\n28.\nAny of the above regulations may be varied as stated in the relevant programme specification e.g. if there is a specific stated stricter requirement by a professional body accrediting the programme, or an exception has been formally approved. If such a variation is applied and results in the termination of a student's registration on that programme, the student must be offered the opportunity to transfer to a non-accredited programme providing that they satisfy the above regulations. Notwithstanding the above, where no suitable non-accredited programme can exist or where local government requirements prohibit the award of a different qualification from that which the student was studying, students will receive the relevant non-accredited qualification equivalent to the number of credits they have already accrued unless local requirements prohibit fallback awards.  Where this is the case it must be stated in the relevant programme specification.\nGuidance and additional links\nIncludes:\nStudent Services; flow chart of progression, compensation and reassessment; Regulations for students who do not meet Honours requirements\nStudents seeking advice on these regulations should contact Student Services.

Its content is only applicable to students who were admitted before that date but may also be of interest to staff across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Please be aware that during academic year 2019/20, the University introduced exceptional regulations in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. This page was previously affected by these arrangements and has been documented accordingly.\nFurther details can be found in the \"Exceptional regulations applied in response to Covid-19\" section below.\nHonours and Integrated Masters degrees\nIncludes:\nclassifying undergraduate degrees; arithmetic mean model; responsibility of Schools offering Joint Honours courses\nThe three methods for classifying undergraduate degrees detailed below are approved for use in the University of Nottingham.\nOne ( Model 1 “arithmetic mean”) satisfies the need of those Schools/ departments which have traditionally found no difficulty in using the entire 100 marks in the percentage scale. The other two ( Models 2 “ordinal scale” and 3 “thresholds”) have been developed in recognition of the problems of classifying degrees, particularly first class honours, where marking conventions effectively discount the use of marks at both ends of the percentile range. This means that very good and very poor performance may be under- and over-stated respectively, or marks at the outer ends of the student's run of marks, perhaps awarded by other Schools, may have a disproportionate arithmetic impact on the classification of subject performance.\nSchools offering Joint Honours courses should select a single model for classifying degrees. This requires a single programme specification for each Joint Honours course and necessitates a single weighting between Parts I, II and III.\nModel 1 (\"arithmetic mean\")\nIncludes:\nunit marks; module marks; weightings; weighted numerical average; borderline\n1.\nUnit marks (footnote 1 in the All awards section below) are numeric.\n2.\nModule mark is calculated from unit marks and rounded to a numeric integer\n3.\nModule marks are weighted accordingly to the number of credits attached to the module - for example, a 20 credit module is weighted double compared to a 10 credit module.\n4.\nThe relative weightings of Part I/II/III marks are given in programme specifications.\n5.\nA weighted numerical average is calculated using the weightings indicated in 3 and 4 above.\n6.\nThe weighted numerical average is rounded. For more information, please consult the following:\nPolicy on marking and grading\n7.\nWeighted numerical average is translated into degree classification according to Table 1.\nTable 1\nI\n=\n70%+\nII-1\n=\n60% - 69%\nII-2\n=\n50% - 59%\nIII\n=\n40% - 49%\nPass * that is, an unclassified degree and therefore awarded without honours.\n=\n40%+ (which can include reassessment marks from Parts I/II/III)\nOnly the following rounded marks will be regarded as “borderline”:\n68 or 69 Borderline I (individual Programme Specifications state whether the borderline is 68 or 69).\n59 Borderline II-1\n49 Borderline II-2\n39 Borderline III\nModel 2 (\"ordinal scale\")\nIncludes:\nunit marks; module grade; median mark\nPlease note, this model only applies to students who entered pre-September 2004.\nUnit marks (footnote 1, under the All Awards section below) are literal (that is, A, B and others) and translate into numeric integer marks according to Table 2.\nModule grade is calculated from median of literal grades.\nOverall median mark calculated by assigning literal grade to each 10 credits. The total number of grades from which the final median is calculated depends on the weighting of Parts I/II set out in supplementary degree regulations. If there is a 50:50 split between Parts I and II then the calculation is a straightforward median of 24 grades. If Part II counts for twice as much as Part I the Year 3 grades are counted twice.\nMedian mark translated into degree classification according to Table 3.\nTable 2\nA+\n78\nA\n75\nA-\n72\nB+\n68\nB\n65\nB-\n62\nC+\n58\nC\n55\nC-\n52\nD+\n48\nD\n45\nD-\n42\nF\n38\nF-\n32\nX\n25\nX-\n15\nZ\n0\nTable 3\nMedian Mark\nDegree Class\nA- and above\nI\nB+/ A-\nBorderline I\nB+ to B-\nII-1\nC+/ B-\nBorderline II-1\nC+ to C-\nII-2\nD+/ C-\nBorderline II-2\nD+ to D-\nIII\nD-/ F\nBorderline III\nWhen calculating the median of an even number of unit marks within a module Schools should assign the higher of the two marks that span the median - for example, the median of C, C+, B, B would be a B-.\nModel 3 (\"thresholds\")\nIncludes:\nunit marks; module mark; module scores\nFor more information about this section, please consult footnote 2 of the All awards section below.\nUnit marks (footnote 1, in the All Awards section at the bottom of this page) are numeric.\nModule mark is calculated from unit marks and rounded to a numeric integer.\nModule marks are translated to points scores according to Table 4.\nModule scores are added together and translated into a degree classification according to Table 5 .\nTable 4\n75%+\n=\n20\n70% - 74%\n=\n18\n60% - 69%\n=\n14\n50% - 59%\n=\n10\n40% - 49%\n=\n6\n40% on resit\n=\n4\n30% - 39%\n=\n2\n0% - 29%\n=\n0\nTable 5\nI\n376+ (eg a run of marks such as 12@ 18 + 10 @ 14 + 2 @ 10)\nII-1\n288 - 375 (eg a run of marks such as 12 @ 14 + 12 @ 10)\nII-2\n192-287 (e.g., a run of marks such as 12 @ 10 + 12 @ 6)\nIII\n128-191 (e.g., a run of marks such as 20 @ 6 + 4 @ 4)\nScores within 12 points of a First, II-1, II-2 and III Class threshold are defined as borderline.\nOther undergraduate awards\nIncludes:\nclassifications; borderlines; calculating an overall average undergraduate diplomas\nOrdinary Degrees and Undergraduate and Graduate Certificates and Diplomas are classified using a weighted numerical average as defined under Model 1 above.

This selection should be undertaken in consultation with their academic tutors and shall be subject to the approval of their School. A School offering a module has the right to refuse admission to that module.\nFor more information about the University's Qualifications Framework, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\n3.\nIn making their selection of modules, students must satisfy any prerequisites, corequisites or other requirements set out in the relevant module or programme specification.\n4.\nStudents may not select modules worth more than 70 credits in any one semester.\nAward of credit\nIncludes:\npass mark; components; failure to pass; Recognition of Other Learning (ROL)\n5.\nThe pass mark for a module is 40%. In order to pass a module and be awarded the credit for that module, a student must also satisfy any requirements as specified in paragraph 6.\n6.\nThe module specification states how the components of the module will be combined to form a module mark and whether a particular mark must be gained in individual components of the module in order for the module as a whole to be passed.\n7.\nA student who fails to pass a module may nevertheless be awarded the credit for that module in the circumstances set out in Regulations 10 and 11 below.\n8.\nCredit may also be awarded under the University’s policy on Recognition of Other Learning (ROL) formerly known as Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL)). For more information, please consult the following:\nRecognition of Other Learning\nCompletion of a stage\nIncludes:\nfailure of one or more modules; progression requirements\n9.\nA student who passes all the modules in a given stage of their course (as defined in the University’s Qualifications Framework) will complete that stage and be awarded the total credit for that stage. A student who completes the requirements for a Foundation Certificate or qualifies for an Honours level or Integrated Masters degree through application of the relevant degree classification model and weightings (see Regulations 22 and 23 in the Classification section below) will automatically complete the final stage of their course and be awarded the total credit for that stage, unless the relevant programme specification contains additional requirements for completion of the final stage. For more information about the University's Qualifications Framework, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualification Framework\n10.\nA student who\nfails one or more modules will still complete that stage (subject to Regulation 11 below), and so be awarded the total credit for that stage provided that they have:\n(a)\npassed modules worth at least 80 credits and have a weighted average for the stage of at least 40% with no module marks of less than 30%, or\n(b)\npassed modules worth at least 100 credits and have a weighted average for the stage of at least 50%\n,\nor\n(c)\npassed modules worth at least 90 credits, have marks of 30% or more in modules worth at least 110* credits, and have a weighted average for the stage of at least 45%.\n11.\nRegulation 10 does not apply to the final stage of any degree programme nor to any module which is listed in the relevant programme specification as not compensatable. A student who fails a non-compensatable module will not complete that stage without successfully undertaking re-assessment in that module.\n12.\nStudents registered on the following types of programmes may be required by the relevant programme specification to attain higher marks in individual specified modules and/or higher average marks than indicated in paragraphs 9 and 10 above.\n(i)\nan Integrated Masters programme\n(ii)\ncertain Honours programmes with a compulsory period away from the University.\nStudents in categories (i) and (ii) above who fail to satisfy the requirements of such a programme but who nonetheless satisfy the criteria as stated in Regulations 9 or 10 will be eligible to transfer to an alternative course, where one exists, as stated in the Supplementary Regulations.\n(iii)\nthe Foundation Stage of any programme\nStudents in category (iii) above who fail to meet the specified requirement may be unable to progress but subject to satisfying Regulation 9 above will be awarded the Foundation Certificate.\nReassessment\nIncludes:\nstudent rights; potential scenarios; progression requirements and options\n13.\nA student who, at the first attempt, has not satisfactorily completed a stage other than the final stage under Regulations 9-11 (of the previous section) has a right to one re-assessment in each failed module where this might enable a student to satisfy progression requirements. The form of the re-assessment will be the same as for the first attempt unless stated otherwise in the module specification. Reassessment marks are considered only in decisions relating to progression to the next stage hence reassessments in the final stage of any programme are not relevant or allowed except in the case of reassessment for a Pass or Ordinary degree or where a student has failed a non-compensatable module and is required to take a reassessment in order to gain the credits and complete the stage.\n14.\nWhere a student has pass marks in one or more components of the module, but has failed the module overall, the School delivering the module may limit the re-assessment to the components which have been failed. The re-assessment mark for the module will then be a combination (on the same basis as in Regulation 6 of the Award of Credit section above) of the marks from the components passed first time and the components which have been re-assessed.\n15.\nAll re-assessments must be undertaken before the student progresses to the next stage (but see Regulation 20 below). All reassessments will take place in August/September immediately following the first assessment (but see Regulations 16 and 20 below), except:\nWhere a School agrees to a written request from the student to take the reassessment at a later date (such requests must be made before the August/September reassessment period);\nWhere a School arranges an earlier reassessment;\nWhere this is not possible owing to external constraints;\nWhere different arrangements are made for distance learning or part-time students.\n16.\nA student may request to be allowed to repeat their enrolment in failed or incomplete modules (which will include attendance at all scheduled classes and submission of all coursework) before taking the reassessment or initial assessments. Requests should be submitted to the student’s School who must consult other relevant Schools, and, where the student is on a Tier 4 visa, the Visa and Immigration team, when making the decision. A School should (if possible) agree to such a request, but there may be circumstances where this is not possible (e.g. where the module is no longer running or where there are Tier 4 limitations on immigration sponsorship). If a student opts to take any one reassessment with attendance, they must then take all due reassessments with attendance (except for modules where a repeat enrolment is not available).\nA module specification may stipulate that in order for a student to be reassessed in that module, the student must repeat their enrolment. In such circumstances, the student will not be compelled to take all reassessments in attendance and may take all other reassessments either in August/September or during the session when they are attending for the purpose of the module(s) that require attendance.\n17.\nStudents may not be re-assessed in modules they have already passed.\n18.\nA student who, after re-assessment, has not completed the stage under Regulations 9-11 (of the previous section) above will not be permitted to progress further on that course and will have no further re-assessment opportunities, except in the circumstances set out in Regulation 19 below.\n19.\nA student who, after re-assessment, has not completed the stage under Regulations 9-11 (of the previous section) above but:\n(a)\nHas passed at least 80 credits of modules in the stage, and\n(b)\nHas an average of at least 40% across all modules in the stage will be permitted one further re-assessment in the failed modules at the next available opportunity.\nIf, after this one further re-assessment, the student has still not completed the stage under Regulations 9-11 (of the previous section) above, the student will not be permitted to progress further on the course and will have no further re-assessment opportunities.\n20.\nWhere a student is permitted to be reassessed under Regulation 13, 16 or 19, and has failed in modules worth no more than 20 credits, they may choose to proceed to the next stage of their programme but cannot be regarded as having completed that stage until the previous stage has been successfully completed.\nAwards\nIncludes:\nconditions of receipt; University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM)\n21.\nA student will only receive an award if they have successfully completed each necessary stage of the course leading to that award. Notwithstanding this provision, a student who has successfully completed the Qualifying and Part I stages of an Honours course and does not proceed will be awarded an Undergraduate Diploma. Equally, a student who has successfully completed the Qualifying Stage of an Honours course and does not proceed will be awarded an Undergraduate Certificate.\n* University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM)\nOwing to the requirements of the Malaysia Qualifications Agency (MQA), the option to award an Undergraduate Diploma or Undergraduate Certificate to students who do not proceed at University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) is not available.\nClassification\nIncludes:\ntable of degree classifications and abbreviations; marks contribution; borderline cases;  extenuating circumstances; flow chart of progression, compensation and reassessment; Regulations for students who do not meet Honours requirements\n22.\nThe classifications and abbreviations for Honours degrees and Integrated Masters degrees are:\nTable of degree classifications and abbreviations\nClassification\nAbbreviation\nFirst Class\nI\nSecond Class, Division One\nII-1\nSecond Class, Division Two\nII-2\nThird Class\nIII\nThe degree classification model set out in the Quality Manual specifies the final mark ranges which apply to each class and how these are calculated and make provision for a student successfully completing an Honours degree course after reassessment to receive a Pass degree without an Honours classification. Programme Specifications state is used for each course.\nFor more information about degree classification, please consult the following section:\nDegree classification\n23.\nOrdinary degrees, Graduate Diplomas, Graduate Certificates, Undergraduate Diplomas, Undergraduate Certificates, and Foundation Certificates may be awarded with Merit or Distinction. The mark ranges which apply for these awards can be found below.\nFor more information about the degree classification model and other marking policies, please consult the following:\nAssessment and marking policies\n24.\nMarks awarded for modules in the foundation or qualifying stage do not contribute to the final mark calculation except in the case of Foundation Certificates and Undergraduate Certificates. Marks awarded on reassessment do not contribute to the final mark calculation in the case of Honours and Integrated Masters degrees and for the purpose of awarding Merits and Distinctions in Regulation 23 above.\n25.\nThe stage marks will be combined to calculate the final mark according to weightings which are given in the Programme Specification. The permitted weightings are defined on the Programme Specification Guidance page, which can be found here:\nProgramme specification guidance\n26.\nBoards of Examiners have only two areas where they may apply discretion in determining classification:\n(a)\nWhen a final mark falls within a borderline as defined in Model 1. In such cases the Examiners will apply the University's standardised algorithm as stated in the relevant programme specification to determine if the classification may be raised to the next highest classification. For more information, please consult the following:\nAssessment and marking policies\n(b)\nWhen a student has an approved personal extenuating circumstances claim in their final year of study, but it has not been possible for the student to undertake a further attempt at the affected assessment(s) before the meeting of the relevant Examination Board), Examinations Boards may consider recommendations from Extenuating Circumstances Panels to exclude marks for affected module(s) to a maximum of 40 credits from the overall average mark for degree classification.\nWhen a student has experienced circumstances affecting their ability to study/take assessments in their final year of study, Examination Boards may recommend that a case be made to Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) to revisit performance in earlier years for the purposes of recommending a degree classification outside regulations.  This recommendation should only be used in exceptional circumstances for cases where there is no prospect of the student undertaking first attempts within a reasonable period of time, for example, in the case of chronic or terminal illness of the student or the dependent of a student.\nFrom September 2019 all students were subject to Regulation 26(b) from the 2019/20 regulations, which can be found here:\nRegulations from September 2019\nThese were updated and from September 2020 all students are subject to Regulation 26(b) from the 2020/21 regulations, which can be found here:\nRegulations from September 2020\n27.\nThere is\nno discretion to\nlower the classification below that indicated by the final mark.\n28.\nAny of the above regulations may be varied as stated in the relevant programme specification e.g. if there is a specific stated stricter requirement by a professional body accrediting the programme, or an exception has been formally approved. If such a variation is applied and results in the termination of a student's registration on that programme, the student must be offered the opportunity to transfer to a non-accredited programme providing that they satisfy the above regulations. Notwithstanding the above, where no suitable non-accredited programme can exist or where local government requirements prohibit the award of a different qualification from that which the student was studying, students will receive the relevant non-accredited qualification equivalent to the number of credits they have already accrued unless local requirements prohibit fallback awards. Where this is the case it must be stated in the relevant programme specification.\nStudents seeking advice on these regulations should contact Student Services.\nPlease also see the flow chart of progression, compensation and reassessment for undergraduate honours courses, and the Ordinary Degrees guidance for Schools, which can be found here:\nFlow chart of progression, compensation and reassessment for undergraduate honours courses\nRegulations for students who do not meet Honours requirements from September 2015\nIf you have a problem or query relating to these regulations, please email:\nug-regulations@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n04 March 2025||"

This selection should be undertaken in consultation with their academic tutors and shall be subject to the approval of their School. A School offering a module has the right to refuse admission to that module.\nFor more information about the University's Qualifications Framework, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\n3.\nIn making their selection of modules, students must satisfy any prerequisites, corequisites or other requirements set out in the relevant module or programme specification.\n4.\nStudents may not select modules worth more than 70 credits in any one semester.\nAward of credits\nIncludes:\npass mark; components; failure to pass; Recognition of Other Learning (ROL)\n5.\nThe pass mark for a module is 40%. In order to pass a module and be awarded the credit for that module a student must also satisfy any requirements as specified in paragraph 6.\n6.\nThe module specification states how the components of the module will be combined to form a module mark and whether a particular mark must be gained in individual components of the module in order for the module as a whole to be passed.\n7.\nA student who fails to pass a module may nevertheless be awarded the credit for that module in the circumstances set out in Regulations 10 and 11 (in the Completion of a stage section) below.\n8.\nCredit may also be awarded under the University’s policy on Recognition of Other Learning (ROL) formerly known as Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL)). For more information, please consult the following:\nRecognition of Other Learning\nCompletion of a stage\nIncludes:\nfailure of one or more modules; progression requirements\n9.\nA student who passes all the modules in a given stage of their course (as defined in the University’s Qualifications Framework) will complete that stage and be awarded the total credit for that stage. A student who completes the requirements for a Foundation Certificate or qualifies for an Honours level or Integrated Masters degree through application of the relevant degree classification model and weightings (see Regulations 22 and 23 in the Classification section below) will automatically complete the final stage of their course and be awarded the total credit for that stage, unless the relevant programme specification contains additional requirements for completion of the final stage. For more information about the University's Qualifications Framework, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\n10.\nA student who fails one or more modules will still complete that stage (subject to Regulation 11 below), and so be awarded the total credit for that stage provided that they have:\n(a)\npassed modules worth at least 80 credits and have a weighted average for the stage of at least 40% with no module marks of less than 30%, or\n(b)\npassed modules worth at least 100 credits and have a weighted average for the stage of at least 50%, or\n(c)\npassed modules worth at least 90 credits, have marks of 30% or more in modules worth at least 110 credits, and have a weighted average for the stage of at least 45%.\n11.\nRegulation 10 does not apply to the final stage of any degree programme nor to any module which is listed in the relevant programme specification as not compensatable. A student who fails a non-compensatable module will not complete that stage without successfully undertaking re-assessment in that module.\n12.\nStudents registered on the following types of programmes may be required by the relevant programme specification to attain higher marks in individual specified modules and/or higher average marks than indicated in paragraphs 9 and 10 above.\n(i)\nan Integrated Masters programme\n(ii)\ncertain Honours programmes with a compulsory period away from the University.\nStudents in categories (i) and (ii) above who fail to satisfy the requirements of such a programme but who nonetheless satisfy the criteria as stated in Regulations 9 or 10 will be eligible to transfer to an alternative course, where one exists, as stated in the Supplementary Regulations.\n(iii)\nthe Foundation Stage of any programme\nStudents in category (iii) above who fail to meet the specified requirement may be unable to progress but subject to satisfying Regulation 9 above will be awarded the Foundation Certificate.\nReassessment\nIncludes:\nstudent rights; potential scenarios; progression requirements and options\n13.\nA student who, at the first attempt, has not satisfactorily completed a stage other than the final stage under Regulations 9-11 (of the previous section) has a right to one re-assessment in each failed module where this might enable a student to satisfy progression requirements. At the discretion of the School delivering the module, the form of the re-assessment may be different from the first attempt, provided that it tests the same learning outcomes and to the same standard. Reassessment marks are considered only in decisions relating to progression to the next stage hence reassessments in the final stage of any programme are not relevant or allowed except in the case of reassessment for a Pass or Ordinary degree or where a student has failed a non-compensatable module and is required to take a reassessment in order to gain the credits and complete the stage.\n14.\nWhere a student has pass marks in one or more components of the module, but has failed the module overall, the School delivering the module may limit the re-assessment to the components which have been failed. The re-assessment mark for the module will then be a combination (on the same basis as in Regulation 6 of the Award of Credit section above) of the marks from the components passed first time and the components which have been re-assessed.\n15.\nAll re-assessments must be undertaken before the student progresses to the next stage (but see Regulation 20 below). All reassessments will take place in August/September immediately following the first assessment (but see Regulations 16 and 20 below), except:\nwhere a School agrees to a written request from the student to take the reassessment at a later date (such requests must be made before the August/September reassessment period);\nwhere a School arranges an earlier reassessment;\nwhere this is not possible owing to external constraints;\nwhere different arrangements are made for distance learning or part-time students.\n16.\nA student may request to be allowed to repeat their enrolment in failed or incomplete modules (which will include attendance at all scheduled classes and submission of all coursework) before taking the reassessment or initial assessments. Requests should be submitted to the student’s School who must consult other relevant Schools when making the decision. A School should (if possible) agree to such a request, but there may be circumstances where this is not possible (e.g. where the module is no longer running). If a student opts to take any one reassessment with attendance, they must then take all due reassessments with attendance (except for modules where a repeat enrolment is not available).\nA module specification may stipulate that in order for a student to be reassessed in that module, the student must repeat their enrolment.  In such circumstances, the student will not be compelled to take all reassessments in attendance and may take all other reassessments either in August/September or during the session when they are attending for the purpose of the module(s) that require attendance.\n17.\nStudents may not be re-assessed in modules they have already passed.\n18.\nA student who, after re-assessment, has not completed the stage under Regulations 9-11 (of the previous section) above will not be permitted to progress further on that course and will have no further re-assessment opportunities, except in the circumstances set out in Regulation 19 below.\n19.\nA student who, after re-assessment, has not completed the stage under Regulations 9-11 (of the previous section) above but:\n(a)\nhas passed at least 80 credits of modules in the stage, and\n(b)\nhas an average of at least 40% across all modules in the stage will be permitted one further re-assessment in the failed modules at the next available opportunity. Alternatively, if permitted by the programme specification, the student may be allowed to enrol on different modules to the same credit value as the failed modules, and the assessment in these modules will be regarded as the one further re-assessment.\nIf, after this one further re-assessment, the student has still not completed the stage under Regulations 9-11 (of the previous section) above, the student will not be permitted to progress further on the course and will have no further re-assessment opportunities.\n20.\nWhere a student is permitted to be reassessed under Regulation 13, 16 or 19, and has failed in modules worth no more than 20 credits, they may choose to proceed to the next stage of their programme but cannot be regarded as having completed that stage until the previous stage has been successfully completed.\nAwards\nIncludes:\nconditions of receipt; University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM)\n21.\nA student will only receive an award if they have successfully completed each necessary stage of the course leading to that award. Notwithstanding this provision, a student who has successfully completed the Qualifying and Part I stages of an Honours course and does not proceed will be awarded an Undergraduate Diploma. Equally, a student who has successfully completed the Qualifying Stage of an Honours course and does not proceed will be awarded an Undergraduate Certificate.\n* University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM)\nOwing to the requirements of the Malaysia Qualifications Agency (MQA), the option to award an Undergraduate Diploma or Undergraduate Certificate to students who do not proceed at University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) is not available.\nClassification\nIncludes:\ntable of degree classifications and abbreviations; marks contribution; borderline cases;  extenuating circumstances; flow chart of progression, compensation and reassessment; Regulations for students who do not meet Honours requirements\n22.\nThe classifications and abbreviations for Honours degrees and Integrated Masters degrees are:\nTable of degree classifications and abbreviations\nClassification\nAbbreviation\nFirst Class\nI\nSecond Class, Division One\nII-1\nSecond Class, Division Two\nII-2\nThird Class\nIII\nThe degree classification model, which can be found below, set out in the Quality Manual specifies the final mark ranges which apply to each class and how these are calculated and make provision for a student successfully completing an Honours degree course after reassessment to receive a Pass degree without an Honours classification. Programme Specifications state is used for each course.\nFor more information about degree classification, please consult the following section:\nDegree classification\n23.\nOrdinary degrees, Graduate Diplomas, Graduate Certificates, Undergraduate Diplomas, Undergraduate Certificates, and Foundation Certificates may be awarded with Merit or Distinction. The mark ranges which apply for these awards may be found on the Assessment and marking policies page.\nFor more information about the degree classification model and other marking policies, please consult the following:\nAssessment and marking policies\n24.\nMarks awarded for modules in the foundation or qualifying stage do not\ncontribute to the final mark calculation except in the case of Foundation Certificates and Undergraduate Certificates. Marks awarded on reassessment do not contribute to the final mark calculation in the case of Honours and Integrated Masters degrees and for the purpose of awarding Merits and Distinctions in Regulation 23 above.\n25.\nThe stage marks will be combined to calculate the final mark according to weightings which are given in the Programme Specification, which can be found here:\nProgramme specification guidance\n26.\nBoards of Examiners have only two areas where they may apply discretion in determining classification:\n(a)\nWhen a final mark falls within a borderline as defined in Model 1. In such cases the Examiners will apply the University's standardised algorithm as stated in the relevant programme specification to determine if the classification may be raised to the next highest classification. For more information, please consult the following:\nAssessment and marking policies\n(b)\nWhen a student has personal extenuating circumstances (which have not been fully addressed by a further attempt at the affected assessment(s) under the extenuating circumstances procedure) such that the final mark is deemed to be unrepresentative of their normal performance. In such cases the School Board of Examiners will satisfy itself by appropriate means that an exception should be made to the normal rules of classification and a decision should be reported to the Academic Services Division.\n27.\nThere is\nno discretion to lower the classification below that indicated by the final mark.\n28.\nAny of the above regulations may be varied as stated in the relevant programme specification e.g. if there is a specific stated stricter requirement by a professional body accrediting the programme, or an exception has been formally approved. If such a variation is applied and results in the termination of a student's registration on that programme, the student must be offered the opportunity to transfer to a non-accredited programme providing that they satisfy the above regulations. Notwithstanding the above, where no suitable non-accredited programme can exist or where local government requirements prohibit the award of a different qualification from that which the student was studying, students will receive the relevant non-accredited qualification equivalent to the number of credits they have already accrued unless local requirements prohibit fallback awards. Where this is the case it must be stated in the relevant programme specification.\nStudents seeking advice on these regulations should contact their School/Department.\nPlease also see the flow chart of progression, compensation and reassessment for undergraduate honours courses, and the Ordinary Degrees guidance for Schools, which can be found here:\nFlow chart of progression, compensation and reassessment for undergraduate honours courses\nRegulations for students who do not meet Honours requirements from September 2015\nIf you have a problem or query relating to these regulations, please email:\nug-regulations@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n22 October 2024||"

For more information, please consult the following:\nCurriculum Catalogue\nAssessment Regulations\nAssessment regulations can be found on the following page:\nAssessment and marking policies\nExtenuating circumstances\nGuidance on managing students with extenuating circumstances can be found on the following:\nExtenuating circumstances\nFrameworks and Programme specifications\nFor more information about the University's Qualifications Framework or Programme specification guidance, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\nProgramme specification guidance\nContact details\nStudents seeking advice on these regulations should contact their School/Department.\nSchools can obtain guidance on these regulations by emailing:\npg-regulations@nottingham.ac.uk\nApproved courses of study\nIncludes:\nqualification requirements; module selection; credit limits\n1.\nTo qualify for an award a student must:\n(a)\nPursue an approved course of study as prescribed by a programme specification\n(b)\nPass the assessments specified in these Regulations and in the relevant programme specification.\n(c)\nSuccessfully complete any additional components that are required as specified in the relevant programme specification.\n2.\nStudents must select their modules in accordance with the relevant programme specification and the University’s Qualifications Framework. This selection should be undertaken in consultation with their academic tutors and shall be subject to the approval of their Head of School. A School offering a module has the right to refuse admission to that module.\nFor more information about the University's Qualifications Framework, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\n3.\nIn making their selection of modules, students must satisfy any prerequisites, corequisites or other requirements set out in the relevant module or programme specification.\n4.\nStudents may not select taught modules worth more than 80 credits in any one semester.\n5.\nThe work presented for assessment for an award of a taught postgraduate qualification must be the result of work done mainly while the candidate is registered as a student of this University.\nAward of credit\nIncludes:\npass mark; module specification; failure to pass a module; accreditation of prior learning\n6.\nThe pass mark for a module comprising part of a Masters, Postgraduate Diploma or Postgraduate Certificate programme is 50%.\n7.\nThe module specification states how the components of the module will be combined to form a module mark and whether a particular mark must be gained in individual components of the module in order for the module as a whole to be passed. A student who passes the module will be awarded the credit for that module.\n8.\nA student who fails to pass a module may nevertheless be awarded the credit for that module in the circumstances set out in Regulations 10 and 11 (in the Completion of a stage section) below.\n9.\nCredit may also be awarded under the University’s policy on Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL) (now known as Recognition of Other Learning (ROL)). For more information, please consult the following:\nRecognition of Other Learning\nCompletion of a stage\nIncludes:\nfailure of one or more modules; progression requirements\n10.\nStudents will normally proceed directly from the taught stage of their course to the dissertation/project stage. Where a student is undertaking assessment in August/September, they may request a deferral of the dissertation/project stage enabling them to undertake this in the next academic year. Where Schools require students to pass pre-requisite modules or demonstrate achievement of learning outcomes before proceeding to the dissertation stage, this will be explicitly stated in the relevant programme specification.\n11.\nA student who fails one or more modules for the taught stage of the course will still complete that stage and so be awarded the total credit for that stage provided that:\nThey have passed modules worth at least two-thirds of credits, and\nThey have a weighted average for the taught stage of at least 50% with no module marks of less than 40%\nNotwithstanding the above, module marks below 40% for up to 20 credits will be compensated if the student has passed modules worth at least 80 credits and has a weighted average of at least 50%.\n12.\nA course may only have progression requirements more stringent than those stated in Regulation 11 above if there is a demonstrable requirement from a professional or accrediting external body. Students who fail to satisfy the requirements of such a course but who nonetheless satisfy the progression criteria as stated in Regulations 10 and 11 will be eligible for the award of a named non-accredited degree.\n13.\nRegulation 11 will not apply to any module which is listed in the relevant programme specification as not compensatable. A student who fails such a module will not complete that stage without successfully undertaking re-assessment in that module. The Masters dissertation/project stage will always be non-compensatable.\nRe-assessment\nIncludes:\nstudent rights; potential scenarios; further re-assessment\n14.\nA student who, at the first attempt, has not satisfactorily completed the taught stage or dissertation/project stage of the course has a right to one reassessment in each failed module where this might enable a student to satisfy programme requirements. All reassessments will take place in August/September immediately following the first assessment, except:\nWhere a School agrees to a written request from the student to take the reassessment at a later date (such requests must be made before the August/September reassessment period);\nWhere a School arranges an earlier reassessment;\nWhere this is not possible owing to external constraints;\nWhere different arrangements are made for distance learning or part-time students.\nThe form of the reassessment will be the same as for the first attempt for taught modules unless stated otherwise in the module specification. The full marks gained on re-assessment will be used for determining whether compensation can occur under the provision of Regulation 11 above.\n15.\nWhere a student has pass marks in one or more components of the module, but has failed the module overall, the School delivering the module may limit the re-assessment to the components which have been failed. The re-assessment mark for the module will then be a combination (on the same basis as in Regulation 7 in the Award of credit section above) of the marks from the components passed first time and the components which have been re-assessed.\n16.\nA student may request to be allowed to repeat their enrolment in failed modules (which will include attendance at all scheduled classes and submission of all coursework) before taking the re-assessments. Requests should be submitted to the student’s School who must consult other relevant Schools when making the decision. A School should (if possible) agree to such a request, but there may be circumstances where this is not possible (e.g. where the module is no longer running). If a student opts to take any one reassessment with attendance, they must then take all due reassessments with attendance (except for modules where a repeat enrolment is not available).\nA module specification may stipulate that, in order for a student to be re-assessed in a particular module, the student must repeat their enrolment in that module. In such circumstances, the student will not be compelled to take all reassessments in attendance and may take all other reassessments either in August/September or during the session when they are attending for the purpose of the module(s) that require attendance.\n17.\nStudents may not be re-assessed in modules they have already passed.\n18.\nA student who, after re-assessment, has not passed assessments as specified in these regulations and the relevant programme specification may be permitted one further re-assessment in up to one-third of taught stage credits provided:\n(a)\nA mark of at least 40% has been obtained in either first or second sitting, and\n(b)\nThe student has an overall credit-weighted average of 50%.\nIf, after this one further re-assessment, the student has still not passed assessments as specified in these regulations and the relevant programme specification, they will have no further re-assessment opportunities.\nAwards\nIncludes:\nrequirements; Postgraduate Diplomas or Certificates\n19.\nA student will only receive a Masters award if they have successfully completed both the taught and dissertation/project stages of their course. A student who does not successfully complete the dissertation/project stage will be awarded a Postgraduate Diploma or Certificate if they have gained a pass mark of 50% or more in modules worth 120 credits (60 credits for the Postgraduate Certificate), or satisfy the requirements of Regulations 10 and 11 above unless PSRB or local government regulations preclude this. For the purposes of the award of the Postgraduate Diploma the dissertation mark will count. Students on a 2 year taught masters programme who achieve 180 credits may also be eligible for a Masters award, whether a named fallback award specified in the programme specification or, where such does not exist, the generic Master of Combined Studies, subject to meeting the criteria for those awards.\n20.\nPostgraduate Diplomas or Certificates awarded under Regulation 19 above will have the same subject title as the Masters course on which the student was registered, unless the programme specification states an alternative subject title for those being awarded Diplomas or Certificates.\n21.\nThe provisions of Regulations 19 and 20 above also apply to the award of Postgraduate Certificates to students registered on a Postgraduate Diploma course.\nClassification\nIncludes:\nre-assessment contributions; extenuating circumstances; borderlines; variation\n22.\nPostgraduate Masters, Diploma and Certificates will be awarded with Merit to students who achieve a final credit-weighted mark of at least 60% and with Distinction to students who achieve a final credit-weighted mark of at least 70%.\n23.\nMarks awarded on re-assessment do not contribute to the final mark for the purpose of awarding Merits and Distinctions in Regulation 22 above; instead the mark gained on the first attempt at the module will be used. Marks awarded on re-assessment will, however, count towards attaining a Pass in the course overall.\n24.\nBoards of Examiners have only two areas where they may apply discretion in determining classification:\n(a)\nWhen a final mark falls within a borderline. In such cases the Examiners will apply the algorithm stated in the relevant programme specification to determine if the classification may be raised to the next highest classification.\n(b)\nWhen a student has an approved personal extenuating circumstances claim relating to the taught stage of their programme of study, but it has not been possible for the student to undertake a further attempt at the affected assessment(s) before the meeting of the relevant Examination Board), Examinations Boards may consider recommendations from Extenuating Circumstances Panels to exclude marks for affected module(s) to a maximum of 40 taught credits from the overall average mark for degree classification.\nMore information on borderlines can be found here:\nAssessment and marking policies\nFrom September 2019 all students were subject to Regulation 24(b) from the 2019/20 regulations, which can be found here:\nRegulations for students admitted from September 2019\nThese were updated and from September 2020 all students are subject to Regulation 24(b) from the 2020/21 regulations, which can be found here:\nRegulations for students admitted from September 2020\n25.\nThere is no discretion to lower the classification below that indicated by the final mark.\n26.\nAny of the above regulations may be varied as stated in the relevant programme specification where an exception has been formally approved. If such a variation is applied and results in the termination of a student's registration on that programme, the student must be offered the opportunity to transfer to a non-accredited programme providing that they satisfy the above regulations. Notwithstanding the above, where no suitable non-accredited programme can exist or where local government requirements prohibit the award of a different qualification from that which the student was studying, students will receive the relevant non-accredited qualification equivalent to the number of credits they have already accrued unless local requirements prohibit fallback awards. Where this is the case it must be stated in the relevant programme specification.\nAdditional information\nIncludes:\nsupplementary regulations for UK-based courses; international campuses; assessment policies and extenuating circumstances; progression and examples\nSupplementary regulations for UK-based courses\nFor more information about Supplementary Regulations for courses running in the UK, please consult the following:\nCurriculum catalogue\nInternational campuses\nFor information about courses running at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC):\nPostgraduate Taught study (UNNC)\nFor information about courses running at the University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM):\nPostgraduate study in Malaysia\nAssessment policies and extenuating circumstances\nFor more information about assessment policies and extenuating circumstances, please consult the following:\nAssessment overview and School responsibilities\nExtenuating circumstances\nProgression\nFlow charts covering application of progression, compensation and reassessment regulations for programmes at Masters level are available: a chart including a progression point and without a progression point can be found here:\nPGT progression, compensation and reassessment flowchart\nPGT progression, compensation and reassessment flowchart (no progression point)\nA flow chart covering application of progression, compensation and reassessment regulations for Postgraduate Certificate/Diploma programmes is available here:\nPGT Flowchart for PGCert and PGDip (from 2012)\nFurther information\nSchools can obtain guidance on these regulations by emailing:\npg-regulations@nottingham.ac.uk\nStudents seeking advice on these regulations should consult the following:\nStudent Services\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n22 October 2024||"

A student who passes the module will be awarded the credit for that module.\n8.\nA student who fails to pass a module may nevertheless be awarded the credit for that module in the circumstances set out in Regulations 10 and 11 (in the Completion of a stage section) below.\n9.\nCredit may also be awarded under the University’s policy on Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL) (now known as Recognition of Other Learning (ROL)). For more information, please consult the following:\nRecognition of Other Learning\nCompletion of a stage\nIncludes:\nfailure of one or more modules; progression requirements\n10.\nWhere Schools require students to pass or to perform at a particular minimum level in the taught stage of a course before progressing to the dissertation/project stage this will be explicitly stated in the programme specification.\n11.\nA student who fails one or more modules for the taught stage of the course will still\ncomplete that stage and so be awarded the total credit for that stage provided that:\nThey have passed modules worth at least 80 credits (or 40 credits for students on Postgraduate Certificate courses), and\nThey have a weighted average for the taught stage of at least 50% with no module marks of less than 40%\nNotwithstanding the above, if stated in the programme specifications for Taught Masters Degrees and Diplomas, module marks for up to 20 credits can be below 40% and be compensated if the student has passed modules worth at least 80 credits and has a weighted average of at least 50%.\n12.\nA course may only have progression requirements more stringent than those stated in Regulation 11 above if there is a demonstrable requirement from a professional or accrediting external body. Students who fail to satisfy the requirements of such a course but who nonetheless satisfy the progression criteria as stated in Regulations 10 and 11 will be eligible for the award of a named non-accredited degree.\n13.\nRegulation 11 will not apply to any module which is listed in the relevant programme specification as not compensatable. A student who fails such a module will not complete that stage without successfully undertaking re-assessment in that module. The Masters dissertation/project stage will always be non-compensatable.\nRe-assessment\nIncludes:\nstudent rights; potential scenarios; further re-assessment\n14.\nA student who, at the first attempt, has not satisfactorily completed the taught stage or dissertation/project stage of the course has a right to one reassessment in each failed module where this might enable a student to satisfy progression requirements. All reassessments will take place in August/September immediately following the first assessment, except:\nWhere a School agrees to a written request from the student to take the reassessment at a later date (such requests must be made before the August/September reassessment period;\nWhere a School arranges an earlier reassessment;\nWhere this is not possible owing to external constraints;\nWhere different arrangements are made for distance learning or part-time students.\nAt the discretion of the School delivering the module, the form of the reassessment may be different from the first attempt for taught modules, provided that it tests the same learning outcomes and to the same standard. The full marks gained on re-assessment will be used for determining whether compensation can occur under the provision of Regulation 11 (in the Completion of a stage section) above.\n15.\nWhere a student has pass marks in one or more components of the module, but has failed the module overall, the School delivering the module may\nlimit the re-assessment to the components which have been failed. The re-assessment mark for the module will then be a combination (on the same basis as in Regulation 7  in the Award of credit section above) of the marks from the components passed first time and the components which have been re-assessed.\n16.\nAt the discretion of a student’s School (and, if different, the School delivering the module), a student may be permitted to repeat their enrolment in failed modules (which will include attendance at all scheduled classes and submission of all coursework) before taking the re-assessments. A module specification may stipulate that, in order for a student to be re-assessed in a particular module, the student must repeat their enrolment in that module.\n17.\nStudents may not be re-assessed in modules they have already passed.\n18.\nA student who, after re-assessment, has not passed assessments as specified in these regulations and the relevant programme specification will have no further re-assessment opportunities. However, a student may, at the discretion of their School (and, if different, the School delivering the module), be permitted one further re-assessment in up to 40 credits worth of modules provided:\n(a)\nA mark of at least 40% has been obtained in either first or second sitting, and\n(b)\nThe student has an overall credit-weighted average of 50%.\nIf, after this one further re-assessment, the student has still not passed assessments as specified in these regulations and the relevant programme specification, they will have no further re-assessment opportunities.\nAwards\nIncludes:\nstudent rights; potential scenarios; further re-assessment\n19.\nA student will only receive a Masters award if they have successfully completed both the taught and dissertation/project stages of their course. A student who does not successfully complete the dissertation/project stage will be awarded a Postgraduate Diploma or Certificate if they have gained a pass mark of 50% or more in taught modules worth 120 credits (60 credits for the Postgraduate Certificate), or satisfy the requirements of Regulations 10 and 11 (of the Completion of a stage section) above. Schools who wish to count the dissertation mark towards the award of a Postgraduate Diploma must specify this in the course supplementary regulations.\n20.\nPostgraduate Diplomas or Certificates awarded under Regulation 19 above will have the same subject title as the Masters course on which the student was registered, unless the programme specification states an alternative subject title for those being awarded Diplomas or Certificates.\n21.\nThe provisions of Regulations 19 and 20 above also apply to the award of Postgraduate Certificates to students registered on a Postgraduate Diploma course.\nClassification\nIncludes:\nre-assessment contributions; borderlines; extenuating circumstances; variation\n22.\nPostgraduate Masters, Diploma and Certificates will be awarded with Merit to students who achieve a final credit-weighted mark of at least 60% and with Distinction to students who achieve a final credit-weighted mark of at least 70%. Programme specifications may, though, additionally state any or all of the following:\n(a)\nA mark of at least 70% must be gained in the dissertation/project stage for a Distinction to be awarded,\n(b)\nA credit-weighted mark of at least 70% must be gained in the taught stage for a Distinction to be awarded,\n(c)\nA mark of at least 60% must be gained in the dissertation/project stage for a Merit to be awarded;\n(d)\nAnd/or a credit-weighted mark of at least 60% must be gained in the taught stage for a Merit to be awarded.\n23.\nMarks awarded on re-assessment do not contribute to the final mark for the purpose of awarding Merits and Distinctions in Regulation 22 above; instead the mark gained on the first attempt at the module will be used. Marks awarded on re-assessment will, however, count towards attaining a Pass in the course overall.\n24.\nBoards of Examiners have only two areas where they may apply discretion in determining classification:\n(a)\nWhen a final mark falls within a borderline. In such cases the Examiners will apply the algorithm stated in the relevant programme specification to determine if the classification may be raised to the next highest classification.\nMore information on borderlines can be found here:\nAssessment and marking policies\n(b)\nWhen a student has personal extenuating circumstances (which have not been addressed by a further attempt at the affected assessment(s) under the extenuating circumstances procedure) such that the final mark is deemed to be unrepresentative of their normal performance.

The remaining 160 credits must be obtained from a thesis module at Level 4. Any taught modules and research training taken must be clearly cognate with the student’s research topic. Supervision while undertaking the thesis module will be as set out in the module specification and in line with the requirements for supervision contained in the regulations for research degrees.\n4.\nThe University’s Quality and Standards Committee has approved a variation in the number or taught credits required for this programme, as permitted under Regulation 4. of the University’s Regulations for the degree of Master of Research (MRes).\nTransfer to PhD\n5.\nA candidate shall not be permitted to count the same period of research for both the degree of Master of Research (MRes) and the degree of PhD.  However a candidate for the MRes degree may, after a period of not less than nine months study for the MRes and prior to the submission of the thesis, with the approval of the supervisor and Head of School (or equivalent), submit an application to the University for permission to be registered as a candidate for the degree of PhD instead of a Master of Research.  The period of registration for the degree of PhD should normally be three years (and not less than two years) full-time from the initial date of registration for the MRes.\nAssessment\nIncludes:\nmodule specifications; submitting thesis before end of registered study; viva voce examinations\n6.\nThe assessment of all modules is as set out in the specifications for those modules. In regard to the thesis module, the maximum word length of the thesis is 35,000 words. The maximum word limit is inclusive of appendices, footnotes, tables but not the bibliography. The Thesis should embody the result of the candidate’s advanced study and research.\n7.\nStudents are required to submit their thesis prior to the end of the period of registered study. Two copies of the thesis should be submitted to Student Services or equivalent (in a form prescribed by the University), who will forward the thesis to the Examiners. The thesis should not, whether in the same or a different form, have been submitted to this or any other University for the award of any degree.\n8.\nThe thesis must be the result of the student’s own work. The requirement does not preclude a student obtaining limited assistance with proof-reading and with the routine collection and/or processing of data under guidelines and instructions clearly devised by the student. When such help is obtained it should be with the prior approval of the supervisor who must be satisfied that the spirit of the 'own work' requirement is not breached.\n9.\nThe thesis is examined by both an External Examiner and an Internal Examiner appointed under the regulations governing the assessment of research degrees, who should provide independent reports on the thesis, indicating whether the thesis module has been passed; and also whether a viva voce examination is necessary. Where a viva voce examination is required by the examiners, this should be conducted in line with the relevant regulations for MPhil degrees.\nFor more information about the Viva voce examinations, please consult the following:\nViva voce examinations\nOutcomes of examination\nIncludes:\naward of degree; where a student obtains a fail mark or failed thesis or training credits; nottingham etheses service\n10.\nThe degree is awarded where all taught modules and training credits and the thesis module have been passed. The pass mark for all taught modules is 50%. Training credits will be assessed on a pass/fail basis.\n11.\nWhere a student obtains a fail mark in a taught module, or fails the thesis module or training credits, the student has one further opportunity to pass those modules. All reassessments must be completed within one year of the end of the student's period of registered study.\n12.\nThe qualification awarded to the student will include the subject of study undertaken as notified to the student at the time of admission\n13.\nSuccessful candidates will be eligible to graduate once their thesis has been uploaded to the University’s eTheses service and approved by the Internal Examiner or, in cases where there are two external examiners, the lead External Examiner. For more information, please consult the following:\nNottingham eTheses\nStudents from countries that are not familiar with the MRes qualification may, alternatively, be awarded a MA or MSc by Research in order not to disadvantage those students.  The regulations for these awards will, though, be exactly the same as for the MRes. This will also be permitted, with QSC approval, where required by professional, regulatory or accrediting bodies.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n23 October 2024||"

        "content": "School Examination Board - The University of NottinghamSchool Examination Board\nThis page provides information on the membership of a School Examination Board, their power and responsibilities, default agenda, records and the Chair's action. This may be useful for staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Membership\nIncludes:\neligibility; involvement of the international campuses; responsibilities of the Head of School\nThe chair is the Head of School or their nominee. Other eligible members are module convenors and module tutors. The external examiner(s) shall normally be present at any meeting of the Board at which recommendations are made for the award of degrees, diplomas or certificates. When, exceptionally and for good reason, this is not possible, the external examiner's absence must be approved by the Chair. Under such circumstances, the Chair shall ensure that the external has been fully involved in agreeing marks and that there is at the meeting a written record of the external's remarks and recommendations on classifications and failures. If absent, the external shall be consulted by telephone or some other effective means about distinction, first class, and failing decisions before the pass list is signed.\nWhere programmes are offered at the International Campuses, there should be appropriate involvement of International Campus staff in the School Examination Board. This involvement may be through attendance at the Board (whether by video link or in person), or through consultation regarding the information presented to the Board and its decisions.\nThe Head of School is responsible for ensuring that sufficient internal and external members are present to enable valid decisions to be taken.\nPowers and responsibilities\nIncludes:\noverview; consideration of extenuating circumstances; undergraduate final year candidates; candidates where programme specification states a progression point between taught and dissertation stages; postgraduate taught candidates at the end of programme; reporting outcomes\nOverview\nThe School Examination Board is the mechanism whereby a School makes decisions regarding progression and awards; in particular, it enables the requisite involvement of External Examiners in those decisions.\nWhere possible, all Examination Boards must be conducted using student IDs and not student names, in order to provide anonymity in the decision making process.\nThe main business of the Board is:\nto receive and confirm the assessment marks for modules taken by candidates following programmes of study for which the Board is responsible\nto receive other relevant qualitative information about the circumstances of individual candidates, such as that provided by Extenuating Circumstances forms\nto make recommendations regarding the progression status of candidates\nto make recommendations regarding the awards, including classifications, to be made to candidates\nThe Board is responsible for confirming marks in School modules taken by students who are following courses of study in other Schools, including exchange students. For Joint Honours programmes, the lead School is responsible for ensuring that its Examination Board is held at a time which will allow all information and marks to be available from the partner School, even if the lead School 's Examination Board takes place ahead of that of the partner School. The recommendations for Joint Honours students should then be reported to the partner Schools for information.\nThis procedure obviates the need for External Examiners from partner Schools to attend the Exam Board of the Lead School where logistical difficulties prevent attendance.\nConsideration of extenuating circumstances\nWith the exception of small Schools/departments where it may not be practicable to do so, extenuating circumstances should normally be considered at a sub-committee/meeting which will make recommendations to the School/Department Examination Board.  The group considering the extenuating circumstances claim should assess the validity of each claim and recommend an outcome in line with the Extenuating Circumstances Policy such that the full School Examination Board can make a final decision.  Full records of the sub-committee/meeting should be kept by the School/Department and a brief summary of circumstances presented to the School Examination Board.  The full details of circumstances should remain confidential to the sub-committee/meeting and should only be discussed at the full meeting of the School Examination Board if strictly necessary.\nA School Board may not alter marks, except in cases where for example a poor question has been included on an examination paper, to compensate for which all the marks for the whole suite of answer papers need to be raised by a certain percentage.

Its content is applicable to staff and students at the China and Malaysia campuses only. Students who are studying away from their home campus, for example on exchange to another University of Nottingham campus, should refer to the complaints policy and procedure which applies to the campus where the issues they wish to raise have occurred.Definitions\nIncludes:\ncomplaint; feedback\nComplaint\nFor the purposes of this policy a student complaint, as defined by the Office of Independent Adjudicators (OIA), is \"an expression of dissatisfaction by one or more students about a university's action or lack of action, or about the service provided by or on behalf of the university.\"\nFeedback\nA student may provide feedback which will be taken into account by a school, department or service when reviewing its policies and operations, without invoking this policy. Students are encouraged to provide feedback to the appropriate school or department representative, Students’ Union, Student Staff Forum (SSF) or service provider in a prompt and constructive manner.\nOverview of student complaint procedure\nIncludes:\nLevel 1; Level 2; Level 3; opportunity for independent review\nThere are three Levels to the University complaints procedure:\nLevel 1 – Local Level (informal resolution). To make a complaint, a student must start at Level 1.\nLevel 2 – Head of School or Service (or equivalent at University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) or University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC)) for formal consideration\nLevel 3 – Faculty Pro Vice Chancellor (PVC) or Registrar (at the UK campus) or Faculty Dean or Director of Academic Services (UNM) or UNNC equivalent for paper-based review.\nAfter the internal University processes have been exhausted, complainants have the opportunity to have their complaint independently reviewed by the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA).\nWho can use the student complaint procedure?\nThis complaints procedure may only be used by an individual who is, or has been, registered as a student of the University and who is not recorded as being a leaver (or, if they are a leaver, is complaining about events that occurred before they were a leaver, within the permitted timescales). This applies to students at all University of Nottingham campuses.\nApplicants wishing to make a complaint should seek information regarding Admissions feedback, appeals and complaints. For more information, please consult the following:\nAdmissions feedback, appeals and complaints\nIn addition, please be aware that:\nA group of students may use this procedure to make a collective complaint provided that one student identifies themselves as the main contact for purposes of communication and has written consent from others that wish to be named as part of the complaint.\nAnyone wishing to make a complaint is encouraged to do so personally. The University policy on Communications with Third Parties is applicable to this policy.\nAnonymous complaints will not be considered unless there are exceptional and evidence-based reasons to do so. In many circumstances, raising a concern anonymously could impede the investigation and communication of the outcome.\nFor more information on communications with third parties, please consult the following:\nPolicy on communications with Third Parties\nFor more information about the student complaints procedure, please consult the following Student Services page:\nThe Student Complaint Procedure\nApprentices should refer to and use the following policy which outlines additional considerations:\nApprentice Complaints Policy\nWhat issues constitute grounds for complaint under this policy?\nThe subject of the complaint should relate specifically to one or more of the following, or comparable issues:\nFailure of the University to meet obligations including those outlined in course and student handbooks.\nMisleading or incorrect information in prospectuses or promotional material and other information provided by the University.\nConcerns about the delivery of a programme, teaching, supervision or administration – including (where applicable) that provided by a partner institution.\nPlease note that in the first instance, the student would normally be expected to follow the partner institution's complaints procedures.\nPoor quality of facilities, learning resources or services provided directly by the University.\nComplaints involving other organisations or contractors providing a service on behalf of the University.\nComplaints relating to allegations of bullying, harassment or victimisation by members of staff are associated with the Policy of Dignity within the University and should be addressed to the Director of Human Resources. If the complaint is within the scope of the Policy of Dignity within the University and informal resolution is not appropriate then a formal investigation in accordance with the policy will be undertaken.\nFor more information about the Policy of Dignity within the University, please consult the following:\nPolicy of Dignity within the University\nStudent Services will be informed that a complaint has been made and against whom (no further details will be divulged). Once the Dignity Investigation Procedure has been completed, if the student's allegations are proven, then the student may bring a Level 2 complaint relating to the impact of the behaviour on their course of study within one month of the date of the outcome letter.\nIf a student’s complaint relates to allegations of bullying, harassment or victimisation by members of staff and to matters which are eligible for consideration under the terms of the policy on student complaints, the University reserves the right to appoint one investigating officer to consider the issues within the parameters of the published procedures for both the Policy of Dignity within the University and the Policy on student complaints.\nComplaints about the behaviour of students towards other students are within the scope of the University Code of Discipline for Students. For more information about this code, please consult the following:\nCode of Discipline for Students\nWhat issues do not constitute grounds for complaint under this policy?\nIncludes:\nacademic appeals; areas with separate complaints procedures\nPlease be aware of the following:\nChallenges to the academic judgement of a member of staff and/or school. The Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) will not interfere with the operation of a University's academic judgement. Dissatisfaction with a mark and/or the academic judgement of the University is not covered by the University's policies.\nCases where complaints are upheld and there has been a clear impact on an academic outcome may, however, lead to an academic conclusion – for example, allow a student a further attempt at an assessment.\nDisagreement with a policy or regulation rather than its application. In this instance, the matter should be raised by the student with the relevant student representative to raise it at the Student Staff Forum (SSF), or another appropriate committee or group.\nNon-academic matters raised by students who are studying by collaborative arrangement and who are studying away from the University at partner institutions.\nA matter of public interest which may be better suited to the Public Interest Disclosure Code (also known as whistle-blowing). For more information, please consult the following:\nPublic Interest Disclosure Code\nAcademic appeals\nThis also applies to cases that would be better suited to consideration under the Policy on academic appeals, including:\nA concern about a decision made by an academic body regarding student progression, academic assessment and award\nA concern about a decision made under specific regulations, such as fitness to practise\nA concern about a school decision relating to an extenuating circumstances claim on the basis of a procedural irregularity\nPolicy on academic appeals\nAreas with separate complaints procedures\nMatter relating to the Student Loans Company (SLC), which has its own policy and procedure.\nComplaints about the Students' Union (SU), which has its own policy and procedure.\nComplaints relating to applications to the University, which are considered separately.\nAdmissions feedback, appeals and complaints\nWhere a student raises issues which do not fall neatly into the category of either complaint or academic appeal, the University will notify the student which specific issues will be considered under which specific procedure and direct the student to the alternative appropriate procedure for the remaining issues.\nPrinciples of this policy\nIncludes:\nUnacceptable Behaviour Policy; quality assurance\nAll complaints should be treated seriously and students must not suffer any disadvantage or recrimination as a result of making a complaint in good faith. However, it is expected that students or people communicating on behalf of a student will conduct themselves responsibly and treat the process and those members of the University involved in the process with respect at all times.\nWhere behaviour falls outside of these expectations, the University’s Unacceptable Behaviour Policy will apply. For more information, please consult the following:\nUnacceptable Behaviour Policy\nIn all cases, it is desirable that complaints are resolved informally and quickly between the relevant parties, and that the formal process is started only if that fails. Evidence of an attempt at informal resolution will be required.\nIn addition, please be aware of the following:\nMediation can be a useful means of resolving matters of complaint where the parties involved are willing to engage voluntarily in the process in an attempt to work things out. The University may make an offer of mediation to students at any stage of the Complaint Procedure.\nComplaints must be substantiated with evidence, expressed in clear and succinct English and submitted within prescribed timescales.\nComplaints submitted outside of the timescales stipulated in the procedure will only be considered in the most exceptional circumstances and where there is good reason, supported by evidence, for the late submission.\nStudents are encouraged to seek advice from an Education Adviser in Students' Union Advice or equivalent office University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) and University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC) at any stage in the process. This includes seeking advice on how to present their case effectively.\nThe University is committed to ensuring that complaints are handled in accordance with its published procedure. Occasionally, it may be sensible for the University to deviate from procedure if strict adherence to it could give rise to perceptions of prejudice or bias.\nThe University will not accept or investigate complaints which it considers to be in breach of the standards set out in the Unacceptable Behaviour Policy.\nQuality assurance\nComplaints form part of the University's process of quality review and improvement and are considered as providing valuable feedback rather than criticism. We will widely publicise information about procedures to students and staff, and all schools and central services are required to provide a link to them through their websites.\nStudents will be notified early in the process if the remedy sought within the complaint is beyond the power of the University to deliver.\nIt is important for students to note that:\nthe Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) cannot consider matters which are or which have been the subject of court proceedings.\nSimilarly, the University reserves the right to decline, suspend or to discontinue a complaint under the Student Complaint Procedure, in the event that legal proceedings are commenced and the claim concerns the same subject matter as the complaint.\nRecording and monitoring of complaints\nIt is important that complaints are monitored in order to improve the student experience. The Complaints and Conduct Team will record and provide reports to indicate the nature of complaints and complainants, and resultant action. Such reports will:\nFeed into the monitoring and evaluation procedure at various levels: department, school, faculty and University;\nFeed directly into appropriate university-wide committees;\nAssist in identifying problems and trends across the University;\nForm the basis of positive publicity, in demonstrating that identified issues have been resolved;\nBe made available to the Students’ Union.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n24 September 2024||"

Its content is applicable to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.1. Responsibility of Schools operating Joint Honours courses\nIncludes:\nappointment of Joint-Honours Programme Liaison Officer\nThe Lead School should be responsible for all aspects of the management of a Joint Honours course (although responsibility for certain aspects of the course may be delegated to a partner School with the approval of all parties).\nThe Lead School should be responsible for ensuring that there are clear procedures for consultation and negotiation with the partner School(s) on matters affecting course structure and assessment.\nEvery School involved in a Joint Honours programme should have a Joint-Honours Programme Liaison Officer tasked with representing the needs of the Joint-Honours community in that school, and reporting to the School Director of Teaching in that regard.\n2. Criteria for determining the degree class of borderline students\nIn relation to students who entered Qualifying year or Part I before September 2015, all Schools managing Joint Honours programs should strive for as much consistency as possible across degrees, both Single and Joint Honours, with regard to borderline classifications. Where complete consistency is impossible due to diverging expectations or demands of different disciplines, borderline conventions should be agreed in advance between the partner Schools.\nWhere there is no such agreement between the Schools concerned, the conventions for award which should be applied in the Exam Board Meetings should be those of the Lead School.\nThe criteria for deciding degree class for borderline Joint Honours candidates should be clearly stated, and the Lead School is responsible for ensuring that they are specified in the relevant Programme Specifications and advertised to students at the start of and during their programme of study (normally in a Student Handbook).\nFor students entering Qualifying year or Part I from September 2015 onwards, Schools should use only the standardised weighted profiling system for determining the degree class of borderline students.\nA student should be given the higher class if either of the following criteria are met:\ni)\nHalf or more of the final stage credits are in the higher class;\nii)\nHalf or more of the final and penultimate stage credits are in the higher class.\nThis does not preclude the consideration of Extenuating Circumstances of students, whether inside or outside the borderline.\n3. The timing and consultation of School Boards of Examiners meetings which consider students on Joint Honours courses\nIncludes:\nconventions; responsibilities of the lead School\nExam Board Meetings considering degree awards for Joint Honours students should be applying previously agreed and published conventions. The timing and constitution of the Board of Examiners meeting will normally be that of the Lead School (including the External Examiner(s) appointed to that School).\nThe Lead School should be responsible for ensuring that its Exam Board is held at a time which will allow all information and marks to be available from the partner School, even if the Lead School's Exam Board takes place ahead of that of the partner School. The recommendations for Joint Honours students should then be reported to the partner Schools for information.\nThis procedure obviates the need for External Examiners from partner Schools to attend the Exam Board of the Lead School where logistical difficulties prevent attendance.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n25 June 2024||"

This information is primarily directed at staff but may also be of interest to students across all UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Overview\nIncludes:\nexpectations of Schools; responsibility of the School (at UNUK); involvement of the international campuses\nSchools are expected to monitor each of their courses to ensure that no major difficulties have arisen and that appropriate opportunities for improvement have been identified. This information feeds into a wider cycle of quality assurance and in turn enhances the student experience on programme.\nAll taught programmes leading to a University award must be monitored, including those offered at the international campuses; this includes sub-degree and taught postgraduate courses. Other issues to be considered will be requirements of accrediting bodies and any issues arising from collaborative course provision. Joint Honours courses and other joint degrees should be monitored by the lead School. Undergraduate and postgraduate programmes will be monitored on separate cycles.\nThe School at the UK campus (UNUK) should also ensure that programmes run at the international campuses (either separately or jointly across campuses) should be included in deliberations at School level.\nAt the module level, the minimum requirement is for each module convenor to consider any changes needed to their modules and to submit these amendments to the School for approval.\nWhat does monitoring include?\nHandling and consideration of External Examiners' reports\nExternal confirmation of standards\nReview of modules, including changes to curriculum, delivery and assessment, and any changes (in response to changes in programme learning outcomes and otherwise)\nHow changes have been communicated to students\nFeedback from students (facilitated by the Students' Union)\nConsideration of how exceptional regulations have been applied\nResponsibilities\nIncludes:\nSchools; Education Excellence team; Planning, performance and Strategic Change; Students' Union; Quality and Standards Committee\nSchools\nSchools are required to complete a monitoring return for each programme run in the year reported on (monitoring reflects on the previous cycle of activity). The UK head of School has responsibility for Quality Assurance (QA) activity (which can be delegated by way of a Statement of Responsibilities) and should ensure coverage of programmes, on all campuses, in returns.\nFeedback from previous reports, External Examiner reports, student feedback, in-School activity and changes, should be reflected upon to produce a written account and a summary of the actions which will be taken as a result.

Definitions\nFor the purposes of this policy, an applicant complaint is:\n\"an expression of dissatisfaction by one or more applicants about a University's action or lack of action, or about the service provided by or on behalf of the University.\"\n2. Overview of the Applicant complaints procedure\nIncludes:\nLevel 1; Level 2; Level 3; link to the Applicant complaints procedure page\nThere are 3 Levels to the University complaints procedure:\nLevel 1:\nLocal Level\nLevel 2:\nHead of School/Service (or equivalent at University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC)/University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM)) review\nLevel 3:\nFaculty Pro-Vice Chancellor/Registrar (UNUK)/Faculty Dean/Director of Academic Services (UNM) / equivalent (UNNC)\nFor more detailed information about the procedure, please consult the following page:\nApplicant complaints procedure\n3. Who can use the Applicant complaints procedure?\nApplicants to any of The University of Nottingham campuses may use this procedure.\nAnyone wishing to make a complaint is encouraged to do so personally. Where a third party (such as a parent or guardian) makes a complaint on behalf of an applicant, the applicant’s express written consent that the third party is acting on their behalf will be required. All correspondence will be copied to the applicant as well as to their representative unless otherwise agreed.\nAnonymous complaints will not be considered unless there are exceptional and evidence-based reasons to do so.  In many circumstances, raising a concern anonymously could impede investigation and communication of the outcome.\n4. What issues constitute grounds for complaint under this policy?\nIncludes:\nDignity at Nottingham Policy\nThe subject of the complaint should relate specifically to one or more of the following, or comparable issues:\nFailure of the University to meet obligations\nMisleading or incorrect information in prospectuses or promotional material and other information provided by the University\nConcerns about the application or interview process\nComplaints involving other organisations or contractors providing a service on behalf of the University\nComplaints relating to allegations of bullying, harassment or victimisation by members of staff are associated with the Dignity at Nottingham Policy within the University and should be addressed to the Director of Human Resources.\nIf the complaint is within the scope of the Dignity at Nottingham Policy and informal resolution is not appropriate then a formal investigation in accordance with the policy will be undertaken. Student Services will be informed that a complaint has been made and against whom (no further details will be divulged).\nOnce the Dignity Investigation Procedure has been completed, if the applicant’s allegations are proven, then the applicant may bring a level 2 complaint relating to the impact of the behaviour on their application within one month of the date of the outcome letter.\nFor more information about the Dignity at Nottingham Policy, please consult the following:\nDignity at Nottingham Policy\n5. What issues do not constitute grounds for complaint under this policy?\nChallenges to the academic judgement of a member of staff and/or School, including the outcome of an admissions decision.\nDisagreement with a policy/regulation rather than its application.\nA matter of public interest which may be better suited to the Whistleblowing (Public Interest Disclosure) Code. For more information, please consult the following:\nWhistleblowing (Public Interest Disclosure) Code\n6. Principles of this policy\nComplaints should be treated seriously and applicants must not suffer any disadvantage or recrimination as a result of making a complaint in good faith. It is expected that applicants and their representatives will conduct themselves responsibly and treat the complaints process and those members of the University involved in the process with respect at all times.\nIn all cases, it is desirable that complaints are resolved informally and quickly between the relevant parties, and that the formal process is only started if that fails. Evidence of an attempt at informal resolution will be required.\nComplaints must be substantiated with evidence, expressed in clear and succinct English and submitted within prescribed timescales.\nComplaints submitted outside of the timescales stipulated in the procedure will only be considered in the most exceptional circumstances and where there is good reason, supported by evidence, for the late submission.\nThe University is committed to ensuring that complaints are handled in accordance with its published procedure. Occasionally, it may be sensible for the University to deviate from the procedure if strict adherence to it could give rise to perceptions of prejudice or bias. Complaint procedures are internal to a university and do not have the same degree of formality as a court of law. As such, legal representation in meetings is not necessary or appropriate for an applicant or the University during the complaints process and will not, therefore, be permitted.\nThe University will not accept or investigate complaints which it considers frivolous or vexatious and observes Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) OIA guidance to identify such complaints. For more information, please consult the following:\nOffice of the Independent Adjudicator\nComplaints form part of the University's process of quality review and improvement and are considered as providing valuable feedback rather than criticism.\nApplicants will be notified early in the process if the remedy sought within the complaint is beyond the power of the University to deliver.\n7. Recording and monitoring of complaints\nIt is important that complaints are monitored in order to improve the applicant experience. Admissions will record and provide reports to indicate the nature of complaints and complainants, and resultant action. Such reports will:\nFeed into the monitoring and evaluation procedure at various levels: Department, School, Faculty, University;\nFeed directly into appropriate University-wide committees;\nAssist in identifying problems and trends across the University;\nForm the basis of positive publicity, in demonstrating that identified issues have been resolved\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK\nAdmission queries UNUK\nUNNC\nAdmission queries UNNC\nUNM\nAdmissions queries UNM\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n21 June 2024||"

If the classification is subsequently changed on appeal a revised certificate will be issued and the office record amended; or\n2.\nDefer graduation to the following set of ceremonies (that is, December instead of July, or July instead of December) by which time the appeal will normally be resolved. If the appeal is successful and the examiners change the classification, then it will be conferred with the revised classification and the University's records amended accordingly.\nStudents should note that classifications are not published in the ceremony proceedings.\nFor students wishing to take option 2 (deferral) a request to defer must be made to the Graduation team (please put 'Request to defer graduation' in the subject line) or equivalent in writing no less than 15 working days before the relevant graduation ceremony to allow the ceremony proceedings to be altered.

Its content is only applicable to staff and students who are based at the University of Nottingham's Medical School in the UK.Principles\nIncludes:\nMedical Act; Foundation programmes\nUnder the Medical Act, the General Medical Council (GMC) has determined that the graduating UK university or medical school is responsible for the recommendation for full registration. This procedure is set within the provisions of the current UK Foundation Programme Reference Guide (FPRG).\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nUK Foundation Programme\nUK Foundation Programme Reference Guide\n1. Grounds for appeal and timescales\nIncludes:\nF1 ARCP outcome 4 appeal form\na)\nGraduates of the University of Nottingham Medical School should lodge their appeal with the Postgraduate Dean, or nominated representative, by completing an appeal form and submitting it to the Postgraduate Dean within one month of notification of the Annual Review of Competence Progression (ARCP) Outcome 4 decision. The Postgraduate Dean will contact the Dean of the School of Medicine at the University of Nottingham, or their nominated Deputy, and forward a copy of the appeal form and any other documentation provided by the trainee as part of the appeal. On receipt of an appeal form, the Dean, or their nominated Deputy, will:\ni)\nNotify the Complaints and Conduct Team who will log the case.\nii)\nAssess whether the appeal is eligible for consideration.\nOnly claims evidencing at least one of the following circumstances will be considered:\nThat parts of the documented assessment procedure were not applied and that this procedural irregularity has resulted in disadvantage to the trainee significant enough to have materially affected the decision made, rendering it unsound.\nThat prejudice or bias on the part of one or more of the assessors took place and can be proven or there are reasonable grounds to support the perception of prejudice or bias.\nThat the decision-making body took a decision which no reasonable person would find comprehensible. Disagreement with the decision does not make it manifestly unreasonable.\nb)\nIf the appeal appears to be eligible for consideration, the Dean of the School of Medicine, or their nominated Deputy, will arrange for an appeal hearing.\nThe key issues of the appeal must be explained in a clear, coherent and concise manner.  If the submission is unclear the trainee will be asked to resubmit the form in a manner that enables proper consideration of the appeal to take place.  A timescale for resubmission will be set. The appeal must be substantiated by evidence and/or a compelling argument in support of their claims.  This may comprise one, or a series of the following types of evidence: a timeline of events, reference to relevant policies and/or regulations, letters, emails, independent medical evidence, witness statements, screenshots.  Any evidence or appendices relevant to the appeal must be submitted at the same time as the form and clearly referenced and labelled.\nIt is the responsibility of the trainee to make their case. An appeal will not be accepted for consideration if: the grounds for appeal are unclear, it is unnecessarily long, it is submitted without evidence or fails to include important dates, times and other details necessary for determining the eligibility of the appeal.\nRequests for adjustments on the basis of a disability which will enable the trainee to access the procedure effectively, should be emailed to the Dean or their nominated Deputy.\nIf the appeal is not substantiated by evidence or a compelling rationale to support their concerns, or if the trainee’s appeal is submitted out of time for consideration (for example more than one month after notification of the decision), the trainee will be issued with a Completion of Procedures letter.\nWhen applying for an appeal, please complete the following:\nF1 ARCP Outcome 4 appeal form\nTo submit your appeal form to the Postgraduate Dean, please send your completed form to\nacademic-appeals@nottingham.ac.uk\n2. Timescale\nA formal appeal hearing should normally take place, where practicable, within six (6) weeks of the appeal being received by the University of Nottingham. If it is not possible to comply with this timescale, the trainee will be notified in writing of the reasons for the delay and the revised timescale.\nMore information on the grounds for appeal can be found here:\nStudent Services – Complaints and conduct\n3. Further evidence and paperwork\na)\nThe Dean of the School of Medicine, or their nominated Deputy, will arrange for a case handler from the Complaints and Conduct Team to act as a point of contact for the trainee with regard to the running of the hearing.\nb)\nThe Case Handler will contact the relevant Foundation School to request;\n(i) That a representative is appointed to make the School’s case at the hearing. The Foundation School Representative should have detailed knowledge of the case and of the reasons for the ARCP Outcome 4 decision.\n(ii) To provide paperwork in support of the decision made. Paperwork could include, but is not limited to;\n• A copy of the Outcome 4 decision communicated to the trainee\n• Details of the warning of a possible Outcome 4 prior to the ARCP meeting\n• A copy of all paperwork considered by the panel which issued the Outcome 4 decision, details of the membership of that panel and confirmation of the rationale for the Outcome 4 decision\n• A copy of documentation relating to the review of the decision, if applicable\n• Details of meetings that were held with the trainee to discuss progress and identify concerns and details of written confirmation of those concerns\n• Details of any reasonable adjustments in place for the trainee or mitigating actions taken to support the trainee during the course of the Foundation Programme\nc)\nThe trainee will receive a written invitation to the hearing from the case handler at least 10 working days in advance of the hearing and will be asked to confirm in writing his/her intention to attend. The trainee will receive a copy of the documentation provided by the Foundation School.\nd)\nTrainees may support their appeals with further written evidence, but this must be received at least five (5) working days before the hearing meets so that the panel is able to consider it in detail.\ne)\nThe trainee will be notified of the names of the panel members and should notify the case handler immediately of any conflict of interest. The final decision as to what constitutes a “conflict of interest” lies with the Dean of the School of Medicine, or their nominated Deputy.\nf)\nThe panel and the trainee will all have access to the same documentary and verbal evidence.\ng)\nThe appeal panel Chair should consider postponing the appeal hearing if the appropriate documentation has not been circulated to the panel and/or the trainee within the stated timescales. It may, however, be appropriate to proceed if there is agreement on the day between the appeal panel Chair and the trainee.\n4. The hearing panel\na)\nMembers of the appeal panel act with the full delegated authority of Senate.\nb)\nThe appeal panel should include:\nA member of the University’s Academic Appeals and Misconduct Committee who shall act as Chair.\nA Director of a Foundation School other than the Director of the trainee’s Foundation School.\nA member of the School of Medicine who has experience of working with Foundation trainees.\nAdditional panel members may also be appointed, subject to availability.\nThe trainee may request that the panel also include a Foundation Trainee Representative from another Foundation School. The case handler will make reasonable efforts to meet this request but it a suitable representative is not available, the request will be declined.\nc)\nA case handler will also be present to take notes.\n5. Support for the trainee\na)\nThe trainee is entitled to bring a supporter. The supporter must be either:\na fellow trainee; or\na member of staff from the trainee’s foundation school; or\na union representative (for example, from the BMA or RCN).\nThe supporter may take notes on the trainee’s behalf, make representations on the trainee’s behalf and ask questions, but may not answer questions on the trainee’s behalf.\nb)\nThe trainee must inform the case handler of the name and status of their supporter at least five (5) working days prior to the hearing. The trainee may be asked to choose a different supporter if, for example, it is perceived that the chosen supporter may cause a conflict of interest or if their presence may prejudice the meeting.\nc)\nRequests to accept representations by way of a legal representative will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Where requests of this nature are approved, the University will normally appoint legal counsel to act on its behalf. If a trainee wishes to be represented by a lawyer, then legal representatives will be reminded that appeal hearings are not courts of law and the panel governs its own procedure, including the questioning to be allowed of others by the legal representative.\n6. Absence of staff or trainee from the hearing\na)\nIf the trainee has indicated their, or a supporter’s, intention to attend, but is prevented from doing so for good reason and contacts the case handler before the meeting to that effect, the chair will agree to defer consideration of the case and will agree alternative arrangements for an appeal. The chair will have discretion as to what constitutes \"good reason\".\nb)\nIf the trainee has indicated their intention to attend, but fails to attend without reasonable explanation, the panel will hear the case in the trainee’s absence. The chair will have discretion as to what constitutes a \"reasonable explanation\".\nc)\nIf a panel member or a foundation school representative is absent from the hearing, the chair will have discretion as to whether the hearing should proceed in their absence, or should be deferred.\n7. Conduct of the hearing\nThis section defines the steps which should be followed during the appeal hearing itself: The chair has discretion to vary the practicalities of these arrangements as they think fit.\na)\nThe chair will ask if any member has been personally involved in the trainee's case at any prior stage and, if so, will ask them to withdraw for the duration of the case.\nb)\nThe case handler will escort the trainee and/or supporter (if attending) and the foundation school representative, into the meeting.\nc)\nThe chair will introduce by name the members of the panel and will explain the powers of the panel and the potential outcomes.\nd)\nThe chair will invite the trainee to address the panel to summarise the reasons for appealing the ARCP Outcome 4 decision.\ne)\nMembers of the panel will be invited to question the trainee.\nf)\nThe Chair will invite the Foundation School representative to make a statement summarising the reason for the Outcome 4 decision.\ng)\nThe Chair will invite questions to the Foundation School representative.\nh)\nThe chair will ensure that the members of the panel have completed their questioning.\ni)\nThe chair will ask the trainee if they wish to make any closing statement, and if they are satisfied that they have had a full opportunity to explain their case to the panel.\nj)\nThe chair will ask everyone except the panel members and note-taker to leave the meeting and will ask them to wait pending a preliminary discussion.\nk)\nIf the panel requires clarification of any aspect of the case requiring further questions to any party, they must all be invited back into the meeting for questioning to take place. They will then all leave the meeting again.\n8. Communicating the outcome\nThe panel can either;\n1.\nReject the appeal, in which case this is the final internal decision on the matter; or\n2.\nUphold the appeal, in which case the trainee will be provided with information as to who to contact to consider next steps.\na)\nTrainees will be notified in writing of the panel’s decision with reasons within five (5) working days (where possible) of the appeal hearing. The decision of the appeal panel is final and there is no further right of appeal.\nb)\nThe Postgraduate Dean will be notified of the outcome.\nc)\nA Completion of Procedures letter will be issued to the trainee by the University of Nottingham upon request, provided that a request is made within one calendar month of the date of the appeal panel outcome letter.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n12 April 2022||"

Its content is only applicable to students admitted before that date, across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.1. Introduction\nIt may be possible for students who fail to meet requirements for an Honours degree to be awarded either an Ordinary degree (see sections 2 to 6 below) or Pass degree (section 7 below) if they meet the requirements for these qualifications.\nFor more information about Degree classifications, please consult the following:\nDegree classification\n2. Structure of Ordinary Degree Programmes\nThe required structure of Ordinary degree programmes is set out in the University's Qualifications Framework (UNQF). There is no Qualifying Stage to these programmes, as entry is only possible via transfer from an Honours degree programme at the end of the Qualifying Stage or Part I. In summary, the structure of Ordinary degree programmes is 100 credits at both Parts I and II (with at least 60 credits at level 3).\nMore information on the University's Qualifications Framework can be found here:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\n3. Programme specifications for Ordinary Degrees\nA separate programme specification is required for each Ordinary degree programme which a School chooses to deliver. Material may be copied from a cognate Honours degree programme specification, but a separate document needs to exist for the Ordinary degree programme. Where a programme specification does not exist for an Ordinary degree currently being delivered, this should be rectified as soon as possible and certainly no later than the date of the School's next periodic School Review.\nSchools are asked to note the following when drawing up programme specifications for Ordinary degrees:\nThere is no requirement or encouragement for Schools to offer Ordinary degree programmes\nWhere there is a pattern of students failing non-compensable components of Honours degree programmes, but performing generally at Honours level, it is more appropriate to establish an alternative (perhaps non-accredited) Honours programme to which these students can transfer than to create an Ordinary degree (see Regulation 28 of the Undergraduate regulations). For more information, please consult the following:\nUndergraduate study regulations\nIt may be more efficient to create a single Ordinary degree programme for an entire subject or School to which students from a variety of Honours programmes can be transferred, but the student must be able to meet all the learning outcomes of any Ordinary degree programme to which they are transferred and the degree title should be a reasonable reflection of the subject.\n4. Transfers from Honours to Ordinary\nThe circumstances in which students unable to progress at Honours can transfer to an Ordinary degree programme (where a suitable one exists) are set out in Regulation 10 of the University's Undergraduate Regulations. In summary, students must have:\nPassed modules worth 60 credits and have an average of 40% across 100 credits and no marks below 30% in those credits, or\nPassed modules worth 80 credits and have an average of 50% across 100 credits, or\nPassed modules worth 70 credits, have no marks below 30% in 90 credits, and have an average of 45% across 100 credits.\n5. Progression on Ordinary degree programmes\nIn order to progress from Part I to Part II of an Ordinary degree programme, students must satisfy Regulation 10 of the Undergraduate Regulations as summarised above (in section 4).\n6. Students failing at the end of Part II on an Ordinary Degree\nWhere a student is unable to receive an Ordinary degree at the end of the final stage, the student has a right to one reassessment opportunity in each failed module from the final Stage.  If, after reassessment, the student meets the criteria for the award on an Ordinary degree, as specified by the relevant degree classification model and the relevant Supplementary Regulations, they should be awarded that degree.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nAssessment and marking policies\nA student failing to satisfy the requirements of an Ordinary degree after one reassessment opportunity, should be considered for a lower award as outlined in the University of Nottingham Qualifications Framework (UNQF). For more information about the UNQF, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\n7. Honours students failing at the end of Part II\nStudents who successfully complete an Honours degree after reassessment may receive a Pass degree without an Honours classification. For a Pass degree to be awarded a candidate must have a weighted final average of at least 40%, which can include reassessment marks from Parts I/II/III.\nWhere a student is unable to receive a classified Honours degree at the end of Part II, that student should be considered for a Pass in that degree (which will be awarded without Honours) either before or after reassessment (see Regulation 22 of the Undergraduate Regulations).\nRegulations from September 2005 to September 2015\nA student who is unable to qualify for a Pass may be transferred to an Ordinary degree programme (where a suitable one exists) and awarded an Ordinary degree if that student satisfies the requirement for an award as set out in the programme specification for that Ordinary degree.\nStudents whose programmes began before September 2004 will be dealt with under the former First Degree Regulations and may receive an Ordinary degree under the provisions of those Regulations.\nFor more information about the former regulations, please consult the following:\nRegulations for first degrees before September 2005\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please email:\nug-regulations@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n29 June 2020||"

Where such candidates fail to achieve pass marks in the modules in question, they may not proceed without reassessment in accordance with Regulations 18 and 19.\n(d)\nRegulation 16 (b) will not apply to any candidate who has a mark below 30% for a module and whose attendance on that module is demonstrated to be unsatisfactory.\n17.\nExceptionally, candidates who have not been permitted to proceed to the following year under either Regulation 15 or 16 may, at the discretion of the Faculty or equivalent Board concerned, be permitted to proceed to the following year provided that they have achieved pass marks in modules attracting at least 100 credits in the relevant Examination and, in the case of progression to Part II, have achieved at least 220 credits in total. All candidates permitted to proceed under this regulation shall be required in the following year to select modules attracting up to 20 credits in addition to those provided for in Regulation 7, subject to such conditions as the Faculty or equivalent Board may impose, and to obtain such marks in those additional modules as, when aggregated with the marks previously obtained in the modules passed in the relevant Examination, will satisfy the requirements of Regulation 15 or 16.\n18.\nCandidates who have not been permitted to proceed to the following year under any of the preceding regulations shall normally have the right to one further opportunity to satisfy the examiners either by September or in the next academic year (with or without residence). The form of the assessment shall be determined by the Faculty or equivalent Board concerned, in accordance with any relevant Supplementary Regulations. Any further opportunity to satisfy the examiners after the second attempt shall be at the discretion of the Faculty or equivalent Board, and shall be accorded only in exceptional circumstances.\n19.\n(a)\nCandidates to whom Regulation 18 is applicable shall be reassessed in all the modules which they have failed, except that\n(i)\nthose who have been prevented from proceeding to the following year solely by virtue of failing to satisfy the requirement of Regulation 16(a)(iii) shall normally be reassessed only in those modules in which they have failed to gain a mark of at least 30%;\n(ii)\nthose who have been prevented from proceeding solely by virtue of Regulation 16(c) shall be reassessed only in the modules specified under the provisions of that Regulation.\n(b)\nCandidates may not normally offer themselves for reassessment in any modules which they have passed.\n(c)\nFor progression purposes, the higher or highest of the marks obtained by each candidate in each module (whether at first attempt or upon reassessment) shall be considered and the provisions of Regulations 15, 16, and 17 applied accordingly.\n20.\nCandidates whose course of study contains an additional component as provided by Regulation 5 (b) (of the Approved courses of study section above) may be required to achieve such a standard of performance in that additional component as Supplementary Regulations may specify, before being permitted to proceed to the following year.\nDegree awards\nIncludes:\nfinal classifications; Honours; undergraduate certificate; undergraduate diploma\n21.\n(a)\nMarks awarded for modules completed in the Qualifying stage shall not count towards the final classification of degrees. Marks awarded for modules completed subsequently will contribute to the final classification, weighted as provided for in Regulation 22.\n(b)\nFor the purposes of final classification for an Honours degree, the mark to be used for each candidate in each module shall be that obtained at the first attempt, but any marks obtained upon reassessment shall also be made available to Examining Boards.\n22.\n(a)\nIn arriving at final classification of Bachelor’s degrees, Examining Boards shall attribute to Part I marks a weighting of not less than 20% and not more than 50% as specified in Supplementary Regulations. In arriving at final classification of the degrees of MSci, MMath, MEng and MPharm the respective weightings of Parts I, II and III shall be as specified in Supplementary Regulations. Final classification shall be determined by Examining Boards, who shall have discretion to consider any other relevant information (including marks obtained upon reassessment) in addition to Examination marks.\n(b)\nThe degree of Bachelor may be awarded with Honours in the first class, second class Division I or II, or third class. Candidates whose performance does not merit the award of an Honours degree may be awarded an Ordinary degree, or may be allowed to present themselves for re-assessment for an Ordinary degree on such terms and conditions as Senate may think fit.The names in each class or division shall be published alphabetically.\n(c)\nThe classification of the degrees of MSci, MEng and MPharm shall be in accordance with Supplementary Regulations.\n(d)\nThe degree of Bachelor may be awarded to candidates studying for an Ordinary degree in accordance with Supplementary Regulations governing such degrees.\n23.\nTo qualify for the award of Bachelor’s degrees, candidates shall follow approved courses for at least three years (subject to the provisions of Ordinance XX) resulting in the award of credits as follows:\nHonours degrees: 360 credits\nOrdinary degrees: 320 credits\n24.\nTo qualify for the award of the degrees of MSci, MEng or MPharm candidates shall follow approved courses for at least four years (subject to the provisions of Ordinance XX) resulting in the award of 480 credits, subject to any additional requirements relating to the level of performance achieved as may be specified in Supplementary Regulations.\n25.\nTo qualify for the award of an Undergraduate Diploma, candidates shall have followed an approved degree course, gained 240 credits at the appropriate level with an overall course average of 40, and completed their registration without satisfying the requirements for the award of a degree.\n26.\nTo qualify for the award of an Undergraduate Certificate, candidates shall have followed an approved degree or diploma course, gained 120 credits at the appropriate level with an overall course average of 40%, and completed their registration without satisfying the requirements for the award of a degree or diploma.\n27.\nThe qualifications of Undergraduate Certificate or Diploma may be awarded under Regulations 25 and 26 even where candidates have compensated fails in modules in accordance with the terms of Regulation 16(a) and 16(b) (of the Progression section above).\n28.\nIn regulations 23 and 24 above, calculation of the total number of credits leading to the award of a degree shall include any credits for work previously carried out in another institution and for which exemption from the requirements of the University of Nottingham has already been granted under the provisions of Ordinance XX.\nCommentary to the University Regulations for First Degrees for Full-time Students\nIncludes:\nunforseen circumstances\nThe objective has been to keep the new regulations as brief, simple and intelligible as possible. However, the intricate and technical nature of the issues to be regulated, the diverse requirements of the various Faculties or equivalent and Schools across the University and the need to establish a sound, formal basis to govern the relationship between the University and its students has meant that a degree of complexity has been unavoidable. The following commentary is intended as an aid to the interpretation and implementation of the new regulations, particularly in the early stages.\nIT IS FOR GUIDANCE ONLY, AND CANNOT PREVAIL OVER THE TEXT OF THE REGULATIONS THEMSELVES\nIt is to be expected, indeed inevitable, that circumstances will arise that were not foreseen at the time the regulations were drafted and which may ultimately require appropriate amendments to be made. It will be important for all Faculties or equivalent to inform the Registrar’s School of any such difficulties which come to their attention. The regulations deal for the most part only with standard cases: where medical or other extenuating circumstances are present it will continue to be possible, as now, to accord special consideration and treatment.\nPreamble\nIt has been possible for the first time to introduce a uniform set of regulations governing all full-time undergraduate degrees within the University, with the few specified exceptions. These regulations deal only with the broader issues; detailed questions of course structure etc. will be covered in Faculty or equivalent, School or Course Regulations, which are collectively referred to in the text as Supplementary Regulations.These will be available in Faculty or equivalent Handbooks and will cross-refer to the Catalogue of Modules where appropriate.\nDefinitions\nThe concepts of course of study, module and credit will by now be familiar to all. It may be useful to recall that a single credit is notionally intended to represent 7.5 hours of student input, whether in the form of teaching contact or private study. The definition of ‘mark’ indicates that the regulations are concerned only with the ultimate mark approved by the Board of Examiners, i.e. after any process of double marking, external validation, standardisation etc. has occurred.\nThe term Examination (with a capital E) has also been defined and will cover all assessments, whether taken in the Autumn or Spring semester, and whatever their form, which are specified in Supplementary Regulations or in the Catalogue of Modules as applicable at any stage (ie Qualifying/Part I/II/III) of a particular student’s programme of study. Any assessments which occur outside these stages (eg. as part of a year abroad or in relation to some other ‘additional component’) or which are not used for the purposes of progression and/or degree classification (eg. coursework utilised solely as part of the teaching and learning process) do not form part of an Examination, however.\nAdmission\nThe first two regulations are concerned with the process of admission to the University and involve no substantial change from previous regulations, except that a reference to Faculty or equivalent Boards was deleted from Regulation 2, since it was unclear that such Boards in fact exercise any function in this regard.\nApproved courses of study\nRegulations 3-9 make provision for the basic structure of degree programmes and for the selection of modules by students.\nRegulations 3 and 4 establish the necessity of following an approved course of study and indicate that the detailed content of such courses will be found in Supplementary Regulations. They reflect the broad purport of previous regulations, subject to some minor changes of wording.\nRegulation 5(a) establishes a uniform Qualifying/Part I/Part II structure for all degrees, with a Part III for the four-year MSci, MEng, MMath and MPharm programmes.\nRegulation 5(b) provides for the possibility of incorporating into degree programmes ‘additional components’, such as the year abroad in the growing number of four-year Bachelor’s degree courses or the Foundation Year in Engineering (at least where ‘home students are concerned). Even though these may be compulsory elements of the degrees in question, it has been decided that they should not attract credits, though they may of course be the subject of assessment (see Regulation 20.).The non-award of credits for these elements arose from the decision that a Bachelor’s degree should consist of 360 credits and that 480 credits should be reserved for Masters degrees such as MSci, MEng, MMath MPharm. Other examples of activities which are compulsory but do not attract credits and therefore constitute ‘additional components’ for this purpose, include certain tutorials and the general essay in certain Schools and Faculties or equivalent and industrial experience placements in Mining Engineering.These are rather different from ‘year abroad’ components in that they occur within the normal three years of the undergraduate course. They have been permitted as exceptions to the general principle that all work which forms a necessary part of the standard three year undergraduate programme should attract a number of credits calculated by reference to the quantity of student input.\nRegulation 6 as a matter of practical reality, students will, as now, be presumed to have attended/progressed satisfactorily unless certified as unsatisfactory in either respect by their Head of School.\nRegulation 7(a) 120 credits is established as the standard diet for each year of study normally to be divided evenly between the two semesters.A 65/55 or 70/50 division will also be regarded as acceptable, however, in order to provide an element of flexibility.\nThe first exception referred to in the final sentence of the regulation relates to Ordinary degrees (see Regulation 7(c)), for which fewer credits are necessary. The second deals with the situation, familiar to certain Faculties or equivalent under the existing regulations and now provided for in Regulation 17, where a student who has not passed in all modules in one year is nevertheless permitted to proceed to the following year provided the deficiency is made up by taking additional modules at that stage. Such a student would in fact have to secure between 125 and 140 credits, rather than the usual 120.\nRegulation 7(b) establishes that all students will have to take in their final year (or in each of the final two years in the case of MSci/MEng/MMath/MPharm students) at least 100 credits in modules at an appropriate level.This is the only context in which the regulations attribute significance to the ‘level’ of modules.The reason for this is that degree programmes will in fact be structured by detailed Supplementary Regulations, and therefore more extensive control over student choice by means of University regulations is unnecessary.\nRegulation 7(c) makes separate provision for Ordinary degrees, transfer to which may occur after the Qualifying year or after Part I. Students who have passed that Examination, either outright or with the benefit of compensation, may not be compulsorily transferred to an Ordinary degree, but departments may find it desirable to counsel weaker students to transfer if there is doubt as to their ability to cope with the demands of the final year. Such students would accordingly have to acquire only 80 credits in that final year, 60 of which would have to be at levels B/3/C.Any student who has failed the Examination, perhaps acquiring only 100 credits, could be required to transfer to an Ordinary degree. Such a student would need to acquire a further 100 credits at Part II, 60 of which would have to be at levels B/3/C. If the option of transfer to an Ordinary degree at the end of the Qualifying year were used, it would simply be necessary to construct a programme whereby the student ultimately acquired 320 credits overall, with at least 60 at an appropriate level in the final year.\nIt is expected that students on an Ordinary degree will make a selection of modules from within those on the Honours programme but formal modular course submission documents may be required at the appropriate time. In the meantime the whole process of transfer to an Ordinary degree should be carefully monitored both by Faculty or equivalent Boards.\nRegulation 8(a) makes the obvious point that the student’s choice of modules must be consistent with the appropriate degree regulations, which may in practice mean that there is little or no “choice” as such for certain students in certain semesters, on account of compulsory elements of the course structure.The importance of counselling will, however, be considerable in all cases where a relatively wide choice is available. Ultimately each selection will require the formal approval of the Head of School.\nIT IS NOT INTENDED HOWEVER THAT HEADS SHOULD REFUSE CONSENT OTHER THAN FOR COMPELLING ACADEMIC REASONS.\nA case for refusal might be where a student had selected a number of modules of broadly similar content–e.g. basic modules on statistics where essentially similar material was examined from slightly different disciplinary perspectives.\nRegulation 8(b) imposes the requirement that student selections comply with any prerequisites, corequisites or other requirements specified as applicable to the modules selected. “Other requirements” would include cases where departments have already detected inappropriate combinations of modules, and have sought to preclude them in their course catalogue entries. It might also indicate that a particular module constituted the first part of a project and that students would be expected also to choose the second part.\nRegulation 8(c) The basic expectation is that students will have demonstrated an acceptable level of competence in any subject area which forms the basis of further study, and it will normally be necessary, therefore, for them to have passed, rather than merely studied, any module specified as a prerequisite. This may not in all cases be judged necessary, however, and departments will be free to waive this requirement where appropriate. Indeed, in accordance with ordinary principles, it would be open to departments to waive a prerequisite entirely, though this is not spelled out in the regulations themselves and is probably a power that should be exercised sparingly. The final sentence provides that students cannot be prevented from selecting a module in the Spring semester merely because they failed a prerequisite in the immediately preceding Autumn semester. This caters for the purely practical point that no resit opportunity will yet have arisen, and therefore the competence of the student in the prerequisite cannot be said to have been finally determined. (Of course there may be every reason to counsel a student not to take the Spring semester module, but ultimately this is a matter of student choice.)\nRegulation 8(d) It will not be possible for a student to claim to have satisfied a corequisite merely by registering for it in the first instance; satisfactory attendance throughout the module will be required. Students will need to be made aware of the fact that if they seek to transfer out of a module which is specified as a corequisite to other modules in their programme, they will cease to be qualified to study those other modules. As indicated under Regulation 6 above, candidates will be deemed to have maintained satisfactory attendance unless the Head of School certifies otherwise.\nRegulation 8(e) It is to be hoped that departments will not place unnecessary obstacles in the way of students who wish to study their modules and are equipped to do so in terms of pre-requisites etc. Inevitably, however, space and safety considerations and the availability of teaching resources will make it necessary to limit numbers attending certain modules. It will be necessary for the University closely to monitor the operation of this process in order to ensure that the viability of the modular system is not compromised. In cases where the module is organised on a Faculty or equivalent basis, the Head of School will be the Dean (who may delegate this responsibility if he wishes).\nRegulation 9 indicates the degree of flexibility to go outside the confines of their Honours discipline that students are entitled to expect. Joint Honours degrees are excluded from the ambit of this regulation because the need to study two disciplines inevitably limits the scope for choice. Certain courses, even though not formally classified as Joint Honours, may need to be treated as such for this purpose if they are managed by an interdepartmental board (eg. Mathematical Physics). Accredited courses are also excluded, for obvious reasons.\nAssessment\nRegulations 10-14 make provision for the assessment process and the acquisition of credits.\nRegulation 10 establishes that the mode of assessment for each module will be laid down in Supplementary Regulations. Ordinance XX is concerned, inter alia, with the recognition of prior study in other institutions.\nRegulation 11 reflects the content of previous regulations, but with some modification to take account of the growing importance of coursework in the assessment process.\nRegulation 12 provides the link between the process of assessment and that of credit acquisition. Credits are obtained in a variety of ways. First, students who pass in individual modules will get the appropriate number of credits -- normally 60 per semester if they pass every module. Equally, students who do not succeed in every module but pass a particular Examination (Qualifying, Part I, or, where appropriate Part II) as a whole (by virtue of compensation) will get the full number of credits for that Examination, as will those who, in their final Examination, satisfy the conventions applied by particular departments to determine degree awards. Such conventions commonly provide for degrees to be awarded to students even though they have not necessarily passed every individual paper. Although the regulation refers to satisfactory attendance, as well as performance, as a precondition for the acquisition of credits, it would not seem appropriate to deny credits to a student who has actually passed the Examination, on account of previous poor attendance. Poor attendance should have been dealt with at an earlier juncture, either by means of remedial work required in accordance with Supplementary Regulations or, in an extreme case, through exclusion from the Examination.\nRegulation 13 establishes that one mark (see definitions) will appear for each student in each module and that 40% will be the uniform standard for a pass.\nProgression\nRegulations 14-19 deal with the complex issue of progression from one stage of the course to the next.\nRegulation 14 indicates that the progression rules set out in the Regulations 15-19 may be subject to stricter requirements in the case of MSci, MMath, MEng, MPharm and BPharm degrees.\nRegulation 15 provides for the automatic progression of students who pass in every module.\nFor ease of use in practice, the flowchart (at the end of this commentary) has been organised from the top downwards, in terms of the increasing number of credits that may be compensated in order to  progress. Thus, the second line indicates that 20 credits may be freely compensated, provided that the overall average is at least 50% and any supplementary departmental regulations are satisfied.The lines correspond, in effect, to Regulations 15, 16(b), 16(a) and 19(a)(i) respectively. Note that also Regulations 16(c) and 19(a)(ii) may apply in any of the first three cases also. Regulation 16(a) establishes a uniform system of compensation which will apply across the University at both Qualifying and Part I stages. Candidates must satisfy all three conditions, namely an overall average of at least 40%, pass marks in at least 80 credits worth of modules and a mark of at least 30% in each of the failed modules.Where candidates do not achieve an overall average of at least 40%, they will fail all modules with marks under 40%.Where candidates achieve an overall average of 40%, but have not passed modules attracting 80 credits, they will fail all modules with marks less than 40%. Where students achieve the first two conditions, but have a fail mark of less than 30% in a module or modules, they will fail this module or modules.\nRegulation 16(b) establishes a discretionary system of compensation, for certain candidates with marks below 30%, which will apply across the University at both Qualifying and Part I stages. Candidates must satisfy both conditions, namely an overall average of at least 50% and pass marks in at least 100 credits worth of modules.\nRegulations 16(c) recognises, however, that there may be certain ‘core’ modules in particular degree programmes which are so central to the discipline as a whole that compensation would be inappropriate. Faculty or equivalent Boards do not have the discretion to allow a student to proceed who has failed one of these ‘core’ modules. In particular it would obviously be incongruous for a student repeatedly to compensate failure in the Honours discipline by the use of marks in non-Honours modules. It is therefore necessary for each  department to specify in supplementary regulations those modules in which marks may not be compensated for students registered for particular degrees. It follows that a particular module may be subject to compensation in the case of certain (eg non-Honours) students but not others. It is also intended that Schools may be able to limit compensation to groups of modules, eg marks in any one of four Sanskrit modules may be compensated by marks in other Sanskrit modules but not by marks in Mongolian. Where a student has satisfied the numerical requirements of Regulations 16(a) or 16(b) but has been prevented from proceeding to the following year because the marks in one or more of the failed modules may not be compensated, re-examination should only be necessary in those particular modules, rather than in all those failed. However there may be cases where Faculty or equivalent Boards are in a position to take a broader view and to recommend transfer to another degree programme under whose Supplementary Regulations the candidate is allowed to proceed.\nRegulation 16(d) provides an opportunity for Schools to deny progression by providing the relevant Faculty with evidence demonstrating that the candidate’s attendance on that module was not satisfactory. If Schools wish to prescribe and enforce a minimum level of attendance that they regard as satisfactory this must be made explicit to students at the start of a module and Schools must have a means of monitoring and demonstrating poor attendance.\nRegulation 17 provides a further route by which students may progress. Like the compensation procedures established in Regulations 16(b), it is not automatic but dependent on the discretion of the Faculty or equivalent Board. It is intended to cater for the student who, though falling short of the standard required for compensation, nevertheless, merits some special consideration. It is included so as not to inhibit students from attempting modules in disciplines distinct from their Honours subject, through fear of failure which might prevent their progression. Such a student might, for example, have obtained an overall average mark of 50% by achieving high marks in modules attracting 100 credits, but have a mark of 5 for a module worth 20 credits. Faculty or equivalent Board might not exercise its discretion to allow this student to progress, given that the mark of 5 is so very low. In many cases the appropriate course of action would undoubtedly be to require a resit in the failed module (see Regulation 18) but there may be cases where a candidate has displayed so little grasp of the particular subject that a resit would be pointless. In such a case the better course of action might be to permit the student to proceed and to take on an additional load the following year. The Faculty or equivalent Board might well wish to impose a condition that the same module should not be repeated and perhaps to indicate further restrictions on the student’s choice. In other cases, however, it might be appropriate to require that the same module be taken again, eg, if it appears that the deficiencies in the student’s approach to the subject could be remedied by a further semester of study, or if the student seems to have deliberately avoided studying the module in order to concentrate on achieving higher marks in other modules. It is entirely at the Board’s discretion whether any conditions are imposed. This procedure is less likely to be appropriate in the case of students who have been denied compensation through failing to average 40% overall, since such students are probably weak in general and therefore less likely to cope with an additional burden the following year. Transfer to an Ordinary degree may be a more suitable course of action. It is to be emphasised that the Regulation 17 procedure will also be available after resits have occurred, and is much more likely to be appropriate at that stage. It should also be noted that a student must have achieved pass marks in at least 100 credits in order to be considered under this procedure, and that it cannot be applied cumulatively in successive years so as to permit eventual carryover of an extra 40 credits into Part II. The final point to note in this context is that it will be necessary in all cases dealt with under this regulation for the Faculty or equivalent Board to identify specifically the modules which constitute the “additional” 5-20 credits-worth in the student’s selection for the following year, since the marks obtained in those modules will be treated differently from the others obtained in that year. They will in fact be aggregated with those from the previous year in order to determine retrospectively whether the student has obtained the full 120 credits for that year.\nRegulation 18 establishes an automatic right to a resit for any student who has not been permitted to proceed from the Qualifying or Part I stage. The form of reassessment shall be determined by the Faculty or equivalent Board on the advice of the School offering the module. Reassessment may take the form of remedial or other work where Supplementary Regulations so provide. This will probably be the norm where the failure involved a project, dissertation or practical work, or was previously assessed by coursework. It is also permissible even where the module was originally assessed by examination, following current practice in the Faculty or equivalent of Engineering. In all such cases the timing of the remedial work and all other relevant details will also be governed by Supplementary Regulations (which will be proposed by the School offering the module). Resit examinations will take place in September or during the following academic session. It is not intended to organise resits in February or June but candidates may be allowed to take normal examinations being set at those times. Exceptionally, Faculty or equivalent Boards may at their discretion accord further opportunities to satisfy the Board of Examiners in the event of failure at the first reassessment. The relevant Faculty or equivalent Board for this purpose will be that concerned with the course for which the student is registered.\nRegulation 19(a)(i) establishes that, candidates shall normally be required to be reassessed in all modules failed with a mark of less than 30%. (This is in contrast to the current procedure where students are required to retake all modules with a mark of less then 40%).This change will lighten the load on the student and reduce the number of reassessments. However, circumstances may occasionally arise where it might be to the candidate’s advantage to be reassessed, not only in a module or modules in which they achieve a mark of less than 30%, but also in modules in which their mark is between 30% and 40%. For example, with passes in 90 credits, an average close to or over 50%, marks in one module below 30% and in the other two between 30% and 40%, improving one of the latter two, in addition to resitting the module with the mark below 30%, could be sufficient (and perhaps more easily achievable) to qualify for consideration under Regulation 16(b). Such a course of action should be the consequence of a decision by the student (not the department), although consultation with and counselling by the student’s tutor would be a part of the decision-making.\nRegulation 19(a)(ii) establishes that students who have been denied compensation of certain “core” modules by virtue of Supplementary Regulations, will resit only those modules which have been specified by their Schools under the provisions of 16(c).\nRegulation 19(b) establishes that, candidates who have qualified to progress may not retake any modules. Notwithstanding these regulations, there may occasionally be candidates with particular educational, medical or personal circumstances for whom a retake (with residence) of all modules in a complete semester or academic year would be the most appropriate course of action. Faculty or equivalent Boards must make clear when exercising this discretion whether such a retake will be a first attempt (ie wiping the slate clean) or whether it will be a reassessment of all modules.\nRegulation 19(c) provides that for the purposes of progression, resit marks will be aggregated with the other marks previously obtained by the student in the Examination, and both compensation and the Regulation 17 procedure (see above) will be applicable. Where a student has had to resit a Part I module in order to progress to Part II the Board of Examiners for Part II will have available both the original and the resit mark. In calculating the student’s total mark for classification purposes (see Regulation 22), the original mark only will be used.\nRegulation 20 provides for the assessment of student performance in the “additional components” referred to in Regulation 5(b). This matter is to be governed entirely by Supplementary Regulations. These may or may not provide the opportunity for reassessment–in the case of years abroad this may sometimes not be possible.  A student who does not achieve a satisfactory standard during a year abroad may in some cases still qualify to proceed to the next year of a different degree–ie one that does not contain the year abroad component.\nDegree awards (Regulations 21-28)\nRegulations 21-28 deal with the question of degree awards and are largely Self-explanatory. Marks obtained at the Qualifying stage will not count towards the final classification and provision is made for the respective weighting to be accorded to marks obtained subsequently. Boards of Examiners will also have discretion, through the operation of their own degree conventions, as to how they deal with failures in individual papers (see under Regulation 12 above). It would be inappropriate, however, for a student to be denied a degree solely on account of failures which had already been compensated at a previous stage. It should be noted that the recommendation that the original mark be used is because the substitution of the mark obtained upon reassessment, for the original mark, risks unfairness to those other candidates who progress without being required to undertake reassessment and who are not permitted to be reassessed in any module they have passed. Good practice in this area would be as follows:\n(i)  If calculating or using averages, the original mark(s) should be used in cases where the resulting weighted overall average is greater than 40%, but where the original mark(s) would produce an average less than 40% and the mark(s) obtained upon reassessment would produce one greater than 40%, the weighted overall average used should be 40%;\n(ii)  If using “profiles”, based on degree class for individual modules, then a failed module which is successfully retaken should be credited with a ‘pass’ only. (Modules which have been compensated under the progression rules should perhaps be credited in the same way, as ‘passes’).\nThe discretion to take account of additional information is expressly preserved. Provision is also made for the recognition in the process of degree awards of credits obtained at other institutions.\nRegulation 23\nWhen considering award of an Ordinary degree the following ways of making that award should be noted:\n(i)\nAn Ordinary degree or Ordinary degree ‘with Merit’ may be awarded to students who successfully complete a departmental Ordinary degree programme (as specified by Supplementary Regulations) which they have been following.\n(ii)\nLeaving aside exceptional cases where a student is required to carry forward extra credits under Regulation 17, every student who progresses into the final year of an Honours programme will already have amassed 240 credits. Any student who passes in 80 or more final year credits, therefore, will be entitled to an Ordinary degree as of right, by virtue of satisfying Regulation 23. In this case the degree to be awarded would be the named degree relevant to the Honours course e.g. LLB (Ordinary) degree.\n(iii)\nAlternatively, an Ordinary degree may be awarded to students who, at completion of their Honours course, fail to meet the criteria for award of an Honours degree, but achieve the criteria required for award of the departmental Ordinary degree.\nUniversity regulations for First Degrees for part-time students\nThe University Regulations for First Degrees are currently under review.  Therefore, the following regulations are applicable for 2004/05 only. Students will be issued with regulations for 2005/06 onwards at a later date.\nThe University Regulations applicable to first degrees awarded by the University to full-time students (other than those registered with affiliated institutions or for the BEd, BPhil (Ed), BArch, BMedSci or BMBS degrees) shall apply equally to part-time students subject to the following modifications:\n1.\nRegulation 4 shall apply subject to the requirement that the maximum duration of a course of study for a part-time degree shall be seven years in the case of a Bachelor’s degree, and eight years in the case of the MSci/MEng/MMath degree.\n2.\nRegulation 5(a) shall be replaced by the following:\nThe Qualifying, Part I, Part II and, where applicable, Part III stages of the course in question shall each comprise approved combinations of modules attracting a total of 120 credits.\n3.\nRegulation 7(a) shall be replaced by the following:\nCandidates shall select and study a number of modules attracting an accumulated total of no more than 70 credits in any semester, and no more than 80 in any year. In each of the first two years, furthermore, the modules selected shall normally attract an accumulated total of no fewer than 40 credits. When selecting modules candidates must specify which modules will contribute, as appropriate, to the Qualifying, Part I, Part II or Part III  Examinations.\n4.\nRegulations 15-20, which govern the progression of candidates through the various stages of their courses of study, shall be applied subject to the following modifications:\n(a)\nThe progression of candidates for part-time degrees shall be considered by the Faculty or equivalent Board each year, irrespective of whether they have studied sufficient modules to constitute a particular stage of their course of study, as defined in Regulation 2 above.\n(b)\nCandidates who have failed particular modules within a stage of their course shall normally be permitted to submit themselves for reexamination in those modules at the first available opportunity.\n(c)\nCandidates shall be permitted to proceed to the following year within the Qualifying stage of their course of study notwithstanding failure in individual modules, even after re-assessment, provided that they have achieved pass marks in modules attracting at least 30 credits by the end of the first year, and at least 60 by the end of the second.\n(d)\nCandidates must complete the Qualifying stage of their course of study within three years of initial registration.\n(e)\nCandidates shall be permitted to proceed to the following year within subsequent stages (ie Part I, Part II or, where appropriate, Part III) of their course of study notwithstanding failure in individual modules, even after reassessment, provided that the Faculty of equivalent Board is satisfied that the candidates shall have a reasonable expectation of being able to complete the requirements for a part-time degree.\n(f)\nWhen the progression of candidates from one stage of their course of study to another is being determined, the compensation provisions of Regulation 16 shall be applied at the discretion of the Faculty or equivalent Board, and in the light of any further opportunities to satisfy the examiners which candidates have already been afforded, rather than automatically.\nCommentary to the University regulations for First Degrees for part-time students\nThe vast majority of the regulations governing full-time students (e.g. those concerning admission, assessment and degree awards and most of those relating to approved courses of study) are in fact equally applicable to part-time candidates, and it has therefore been decided not to draft a completely new set to govern the latter category. Rather, the full-time regulations  (FT Regs) will apply, but subject to certain modifications necessary to address the peculiarities of part-time status.\nRegulation 1 modifies FT Reg 4 by establishing that, while approved courses of study will continue to be prescribed by Supplementary Regulations, there will be a duration for part-time degrees of 7 years in the case of a Bachelor’s degree and 8 years for the MSci/MEng/MMath. It is thought undesirable to allow the protraction of part-time study beyond such periods. Naturally this regulation, like all others, can be overridden in cases of illness or other compassionate circumstances.\nRegulation 2 In the case of full-time students, the various stages of the degree course (Qualifying, Part 1 etc.) are exactly co-terminous with academic years. In the case of part-timers, this symmetry is broken, and it has therefore been necessary to replace FT Reg 5(a) and re-define each stage in terms of approved combinations of modules attracting 120 credits. This means that each part-time student’s programme of study will have to be individually planned and then approved by the Head of School concerned. It is anticipated that the programme will follow the full-time course of study as closely as possible, though inevitably it will spread over a longer period of time. In some cases it may be necessary to modify the precise sequence in which modules are taken, in order to achieve the necessary flexibility and accommodate student availability.\nRegulation 3 Although the intention has been to achieve as much flexibility as possible, there are various constraints, particularly of a financial kind, which have to be recognised. It has been thought desirable, for example, to encourage part-time study by maintaining the current low level of fees which such students are charged. This in turn makes it appropriate to preserve a substantial differential between such students and their full-time counterparts in terms of the quantity of teaching they receive. This regulation therefore establishes that part-time students may take a maximum of 80-credits-worth of modules in any year (i.e. two-thirds of the full-time equivalent.) The maximum per semester, however, is 70 (i.e. the same as the full-time equivalent) to allow for the possibility that the part-timer may wish to concentrate his/her studies into one semester of the year. On the other hand, it has also been thought desirable to require a certain minimum commitment from part-timers, at least in the early period of their studies, and this has been fixed at a level of 40-credits-worth of modules in each of the first two years of study. This requirement will serve to distinguish them from those taking individual modules as occasional students or as part of a continuing education programme. It should be remembered, however, that students within the latter categories who subsequently wish to register for a part-time degree will be in a position to apply under APL procedures for credit in respect of any modules which they have previously studied outside of any formal degree programme. One inevitable consequence of the breaking of the link between the various stages of the part-time degree and the academic years of study (see under Regulation 2 above) will be an element of administrative complexity. For example, a part-time student who takes modules attracting the maximum 80 credits in each of the first two years will obviously, in the second year, be taking some Qualifying and some Part I modules.\nIT WILL BE ESSENTIAL, IN ALL CASES WHERE THE MODULES TAKEN IN ANY YEAR SPAN DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE COURSE OF STUDY,THAT THE DEPARTMENT WHICH APPROVES THE STUDENT’S SELECTION ALSO IDENTIFIES EACH MODULE AS BELONGING TO THE QUALIFYING STAGE, PART I ETC. AS APPROPRIATE.\nThis is a matter which will have to be resolved at registration, and it is hoped that the registration forms for part-time students will be able to accommodate this requirement.\nRegulation 4 It is in the area of the progression of part-time students that the major differences will occur. Paragraph (a) provides that FT Regs 15-20, which are expressed in such a way as to govern the progression of full-time students from one year of their course of study to the next, will be applied in the case of part-timers to regulate their progression from one stage of their course of study to the next. It is anticipated that the rules will then apply in similar fashion to part-time students as to their full-time counterparts, except that the compensation process established by FT Reg 16(a) will operate at the discretion of the Faculty or equivalent Board, rather than automatically. The reason for this apparently less favourable treatment is that part-time students may well already have had the benefit of resit opportunities (see under Regulation 5 below) by the time when their progression from one stage of their course to another is considered.This cannot occur in the case of full-time students. It is not intended to make special arrangements to consider the progression of part-timers at the end of the first semester, even if they happen to have completed sufficient modules to constitute a particular stage of their course at that time. Examiners’ meetings will only take place in June. It therefore seems likely that the progression of part-timers will throw up a greater number of anomalies than that of full-timers. Where in a particular year a student has studied a number of modules which range across different stages of her/his course, for example, it could occur that (s)he fails to pass the Qualifying stage, even though marks already available to the Faculty or equivalent Board reveal a sparkling performance in certain Part I modules. It seems unwise, however, to seek to anticipate such cases in the Regulations. If necessary they can be the subject of ad hoc consideration as they arise. Apart from the need to consider the progression of part-timers after they have studied sufficient modules to constitute a particular stage of their course of study, it is also judged to be appropriate to consider their progression each year -- i.e. within particular stages of their course. In particular, it seems unwise to allow a student to continue through three years of an attempt to pass the Qualifying stage if the first year’s performance is disastrous.\nParagraph (b) establishes the principle that failure in a module should normally be followed by resit at the first available opportunity--it is not generally considered desirable to allow students to gamble that they will ultimately compensate on the basis of future years’ marks.\nParagraphs (c) and (d) seek to establish certain minimum criteria to regulate the progression of students from one year of the Qualifying stage to the next. A uniform requirement of passing in at least 30 credits-worth of modules by the end of the first year, and 60 by the end of the second, is imposed. As the regulations stand, this will apply regardless of how many modules the student has attempted, which could range from 80 to 160 credits-worth by the end of year two. It will also be the case that the student who achieves 60 or more credits by the end of year 1 will not need to achieve any more in year two. On the other hand, the Qualifying stage must be completed within three years, so there should not be undue temptation to ‘coast’ during this period. Once the Qualifying stage is complete, no specific criteria are contemplated to govern progression within subsequent stages.The guiding principle will be that the student will be allowed to progress provided the Faculty or equivalent Board judges that there is a reasonable prospect of completion within the 7 or 8 year period.\nParagraphs (e) and (f) further deal with the progression of candidates from one stage to another.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n08 April 2022||"

This selection should be undertaken in consultation with their academic tutors and shall be subject to the approval of their Head of School. A School offering a module has the right to refuse admission to that module.\nFor more information about the University's Qualifications Framework, please consult the following:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\n3.\nIn making their selection of modules, students must satisfy any prerequisites, corequisites or other requirements set out in the relevant module or programme specification.\n4.\nStudents may not select taught modules worth more than 80 credits in any one semester.\n5.\nThe work presented for assessment for an award of a taught postgraduate qualification must be the result of work done mainly while the candidate is registered as a student of this University.\nAward of credit\nIncludes:\npass mark; components; failure to pass; Recognition of Other Learning (ROL)\n6.\nThe pass mark for a module comprising part of a Masters, Postgraduate Diploma or Postgraduate Certificate programme is 50%.\n7.\nThe module specification states how the components of the module will be combined to form a module mark and whether a particular mark must be gained in individual components of the module in order for the module as a whole to be passed. A student who passes the module will be awarded the credit for that module.\n8.\nA student who fails to pass a module may nevertheless be awarded the credit for that module in the circumstances set out in Regulations 10 and 11 (in the Completion of a stage section) below.\n9.\nCredit may also be awarded under the University’s policy on Recognition of Other Learning (formerly known as Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL)). For more information, please consult the following:\nRecognition of Other Learning\nCompletion of a stage\nIncludes:\nfailure of one or more modules; progression requirements\n10.\nStudents will normally proceed directly from the taught stage of their course to the dissertation/project stage. Where a student is undertaking assessment in August/September, they may request a deferral of the dissertation/project stage enabling them to undertake this in the next academic year. Where Schools require students to pass pre-requisite modules or demonstrate achievement of learning outcomes before proceeding to the dissertation stage, this will be explicitly stated in the relevant programme specification.\n11.\nA student who fails one or more modules for the taught stage of the course will still complete that stage and so be awarded the total credit for that stage provided that:\nThey have passed modules worth at least two-thirds of credits, and\nThey have a weighted average for the taught stage of at least 50% with no module marks of less than 40%\nNotwithstanding the above, module marks below 40% for up to 20 credits will be compensated if the student has passed modules worth at least 80 credits and has a weighted average of at least 50%.\n12.\nA course may only have progression requirements more stringent than those stated in Regulation 11 above if there is a demonstrable requirement from a professional or accrediting external body. Students who fail to satisfy the requirements of such a course but who nonetheless satisfy the progression criteria as stated in Regulations 10 and 11 will be eligible for the award of a named non-accredited degree.\n13.\nRegulation 11 will not apply to any module which is listed in the relevant programme specification as not compensatable. A student who fails such a module will not complete that stage without successfully undertaking re-assessment in that module. The Masters dissertation/project stage will always be non-compensatable.\nRe-assessment\nIncludes:\nstudent rights; potential scenarios; further re-assessment\n14.\nA student who, at the first attempt, has not satisfactorily completed the taught stage or dissertation/project stage of the course has a right to one reassessment in each failed module where this might enable a student to satisfy programme requirements. All reassessments will take place in August/September immediately following the first assessment, except:\nWhere a School agrees to a written request from the student to take the reassessment at a later date (such requests must be made before the August/September reassessment period);\nWhere a School arranges an earlier reassessment;\nWhere this is not possible owing to external constraints;\nWhere different arrangements are made for distance learning or part-time students.\nThe form of the reassessment will be the same as for the first attempt for taught modules unless stated otherwise in the module specification. The full marks gained on re-assessment will be used for determining whether compensation can occur under the provision of Regulation 11 (in the Completion of a stage section) above.\n15.\nWhere a student has pass marks in one or more components of the module, but has failed the module overall, the School delivering the module may limit the re-assessment to the components which have been failed. The re-assessment mark for the module will then be a combination (on the same basis as in Regulation 7 of the Award of credit section above) of the marks from the components passed first time and the components which have been re-assessed.\n16.\nA student may request to be allowed to repeat their enrolment in failed modules (which will include attendance at all scheduled classes and submission of all coursework) before taking the re-assessments. Requests should be submitted to the student’s School who must consult other relevant Schools when making the decision. A School should (if possible) agree to such a request, but there may be circumstances where this is not possible (e.g. where the module is no longer running). If a student opts to take any one reassessment with attendance, they must then take all due reassessments with attendance (except for modules where a repeat enrolment is not available).\nA module specification may stipulate that, in order for a student to be re-assessed in a particular module, the student must repeat their enrolment in that module. In such circumstances, the student will not be compelled to take all reassessments in attendance and may take all other reassessments either in August/September or during the session when they are attending for the purpose of the module(s) that require attendance.\n17.\nStudents may not be re-assessed in modules they have already passed.\n18.\nA student who, after re-assessment, has not passed assessments as specified in these regulations and the relevant programme specification may be permitted one further re-assessment in up to one-third of taught stage credits provided:\n(a)\nA mark of at least 40% has been obtained in either first or second sitting, and\n(b)\nThe student has an overall credit-weighted average of 50%.\nIf, after this one further re-assessment, the student has still not passed assessments as specified in these regulations and the relevant programme specification, they will have no further re-assessment opportunities.\nAwards\nIncludes:\nrequirements; Postgraduate Diplomas or Certificates\n19.\nA student will only receive a Masters award if they have successfully completed both the taught and dissertation/project stages of their course. A student who does not successfully complete the dissertation/project stage will be awarded a Postgraduate Diploma or Certificate if they have gained a pass mark of 50% or more in modules worth 120 credits (60 credits for the Postgraduate Certificate), or satisfy the requirements of Regulations 10 and 11 (of the Completion of a stage section) above unless Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Body (PSRB) or local government regulations preclude this. For the purposes of the award of the Postgraduate Diploma the dissertation mark will count. Students on a 2 year taught masters programme who achieve 180 credits may also be eligible for a Masters award, whether a named fallback award specified in the programme specification or, where such does not exist, the generic Master of Combined Studies, subject to meeting the criteria for those awards.\n20.\nPostgraduate Diplomas or Certificates awarded under Regulation 19 above will have the same subject title as the Masters course on which the student was registered, unless the programme specification states an alternative subject title for those being awarded Diplomas or Certificates.\n21.\nThe provisions of Regulations 19 and 20 above also apply to the award of Postgraduate Certificates to students registered on a Postgraduate Diploma course.\nClassification\nIncludes:\nre-assessment contributions; extenuating circumstances; borderlines; variation\n22.\nPostgraduate Masters, Diploma and Certificates will be awarded with Merit to students who achieve a final credit-weighted mark of at least 60% and with Distinction to students who achieve a final credit-weighted mark of at least 70%.\n23.\nMarks awarded on re-assessment do not contribute to the final mark for the purpose of awarding Merits and Distinctions in Regulation 22 above; instead the mark gained on the first attempt at the module will be used. Marks awarded on re-assessment will, however, count towards attaining a Pass in the course overall.\n24.\nNormally the degree classification awarded is determined entirely by the final average mark (weighted by credits and year of study as defined in the programme specifications) according to the model in the Degree Classification section of the Quality Manual.\nFor more information about this model, please consult the following:\nDegree classification\nThere are, however two situations in which further considerations come into play.\n(a)\nWhere the final mark falls within a borderline (as defined in the Degree Classification section of the Quality Manual). In such a case the Examiners will apply the University's standardised algorithm (as described in the APAR section of the Quality Manual) to determine whether the classification may be raised to the next higher classification. In considering the fraction of credits at the higher level, all modules are to be counted even those that have been excluded from the calculation of the final average under 24(b).\n(b)\nWhere the student has approved extenuating circumstances claims satisfying each of the following. The claims\ni)\nAre for modules attracting no more than 20 credits\nii)\nAre in the final stage/year for which a further attempt at the assessment has not been possible by the time of the Examination Board’s meeting.\niii)\nAre not due to examination absences covered by the self-certification policy\nIn this situation, marks from those modules only may be excluded from the calculation of the final average provided that:\ni)\nMarks from all such affected modules are discounted;\nii)\nAll non-compensatable modules have been passed;\niii)\nThe Extenuating Circumstances panel can clearly demonstrate that the final mark after the exclusion is more representative of the student’s normal performance (normally by showing that the excluded module marks are significantly anomalous);\nStudents may decline the application of regulation 24(b) and opt to undertake a further attempt at the affected assessments, but will not graduate until they have completed those reassessments.\nAll instances in which such exclusions are applied should be communicated to Student Services Development (Academic Processes) for report to Quality and Standards Committee (QSC). Reports should be submitted at the same time as the main Examination Board recommendations in November (Taught Postgraduate programmes).\nFor more information, please email:\nStudent Services Development (Academic Processes)\n25.\nThere is no discretion to lower the classification below that indicated by the final mark.\n26.\nAny of the above regulations may be varied as stated in the relevant programme specification where an exception has been formally approved.  If such a variation is applied and results in the termination of a student's registration on that programme, the student must be offered the opportunity to transfer to a non-accredited programme providing that they satisfy the above regulations. Notwithstanding the above, where no suitable non-accredited programme can exist or where local government requirements prohibit the award of a different qualification from that which the student was studying, students will receive the relevant non-accredited qualification equivalent to the number of credits they have already accrued unless local requirements prohibit fallback awards. Where this is the case it must be stated in the relevant programme specification.\nAdditional information\nIncludes:\nsupplementary regulations for UK-based courses; international campuses; assessment policies and extenuating circumstances; progression and examples\nSupplementary regulations for UK-based courses\nFor more information about Supplementary Regulations for courses running in the UK, please consult the following:\nCurriculum Catalogue\nInternational campuses\nFor more information about courses running at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC), please consult the following:\nPostgraduate Taught study (UNNC)\nFor more information about courses running at the University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM), please consult the following:\nPostgraduate study (UNM)\nAssessment policies and extenuating circumstances\nFor more information about assessment policies and extenuating circumstances, please consult the following:\nAssessment overview and School responsibilities\nExtenuating circumstances\nProgression\nFlow charts covering application of progression, compensation and reassessment regulations for programmes at Masters level are available: a chart including a progression point and without a progression point can be found here:\nPGT progression, compensation and reassessment flowchart\nPGT progression, compensation and reassessment flowchart (no progression point)\nA flow chart covering application of progression, compensation and reassessment regulations for Postgraduate Certificate/Diploma programmes is available here:\nPGT Flowchart for PGCert and PGDip (from 2012)\nFurther information\nSchools can obtain guidance on these regulations by emailing:\npg-regulations@nottingham.ac.uk\nStudents seeking advice on these regulations should consult the following:\nStudent Services\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n22 October 2024||"

The minimum period of registration for this programme will be two years full-time supervised study or four years part-time study (with the normal periods being three years full-time or six years part-time study). Students will also be entitled to a thesis pending period on completion of their period of registered study (one year for full-time students, two years for part-time students).\n3 Taught Component\nRegulations should cover the following information:\n(a)\nThe number of taught credits students are required to complete satisfactorily; students on a Professional Doctorate course must take a minimum of 120 credits and all modules taken must be at level 4 or 5.\n(b)\nThe time limit by which taught modules should be completed (e.g. by the end of the first year for full-time students or by the end of the second year for part-time students). Regulations should also state that students should select modules in consultation with their supervisor(s) or that choice of modules is subject to approval by the Programme Convenor.\n(c)\nIf available, the regulations should list the titles, codes and weighting of taught modules to be taken as part of the programme. If appropriate, further information on the form of assessment to be undertaken can also be included.\n(d)\nThe minimum pass mark for taught modules on a Professional Doctorate is 50%.\n(e)\nIf compensation is allowed for failing any of the taught modules, this should also be stated. Likewise, if students satisfy requirements for the taught component by achieving an average of 50% overall, this should also be stated.\n(f)\nIt may be that some Schools will wish to include an element of generic research training by requiring students to take courses offered from within the Research Training Programme run by the Researcher Academy (or equivalent). In this case, regulations should cover requirements for satisfying completion of this part of the course (i.e. that students would be expected to obtain certificates for each course certifying at least 70% attendance).\n4 Re-assessment\nRegulations should also contain information on re-assessment for the information of students. A general paragraph could read as follows:\nStudents who fail to satisfy the Examiners in any of the modules which are part of the taught component may be re-examined on such terms as the Academic Board, on the recommendation of the School, may decide. Students may normally be re-examined on one occasion only.\n5 Interim Awards\nSchools may wish to consider whether it would be appropriate for an interim award to be available for students, though this would only be an option where the taught element of the programme was sufficiently large to enable students to qualify for such an award under University Regulations for Taught Postgraduate Degrees (60 credits for a Postgraduate Certificate, 120 credits for a Postgraduate Diploma and 180 credits for a Master’s qualification). If so, this option should be covered as follows:\nStudents who complete successfully the taught element but who do not successfully complete the thesis may be awarded a Postgraduate Certificate/Diploma/MA.\nIf such taught awards are not already in existence, it will be necessary for the School to complete a programme specification for approval as with any other taught course. For more information, please consult the following:\nProgramme design, development and approval\n6 Thesis or final assessment to be completed satisfactorily to qualify for the award of the Professional Doctorate\nGuidance for this part of the regulations should cover the following factors:\nThe required word limit for the dissertation or other form of assessment which contributes towards the final award of the qualification; the University’s expectation is that this component will be around 50,000 words in length\nAny extra requirements for a particular course\nThe academic criteria which the final assessment should satisfy\nReference to the requirement that the work has been mainly carried out while the student has been registered for the degree\nThe standard deadline by which students are expected to submit their thesis or other form(s) of assessment (ie up to one calendar year after completion of the period of supervised study for full-time students, and two calendar years for part-time students).\n7 Award of Qualification\nSchools should liaise with Student Services over the appointment of External Examiners with regard to the assessment of the modules comprising the taught element of the programme.\nIt may be appropriate in some instances to consider how the thesis component of the course should be examined and whether it would be appropriate for an additional External Examiner (an expert practitioner in the field, for example) to be appointed in addition to an Internal Examiner and an External Examiner.\nRegulations should include a standard paragraph as follows:\nThe degree of …. will be conferred on students who have completed the taught programme, submitted a thesis [or other form of assessment] in a form and of a standard as outlined above [plus any other requirements which the particular qualification requires]. Students are required to present themselves for a viva voce examination to be conducted by one internal (academic) Examiner, one external (academic) Examiner plus any further examiner as deemed appropriate for the particular qualification.\nFailure\nThe standard wording for this regulation should be as follows:\n“A student for the degree of … whose thesis fails to satisfy the Examiners may be allowed to:\n(a)\nmake minor corrections to the thesis to the satisfaction of the internal (academic) Examiner; or\n(b)\nto represent the same thesis and attend a second viva voce examination; or\n(c)\nto represent the thesis in a revised form and take the whole examination; or\n(d)\nto represent the thesis without taking the whole examination.\nA student proceeding under this regulation shall normally be required to pursue a further course of directed study for a specified period that will not normally exceed one calendar year.”\nAgain, where the assessment is in an alternative format to a thesis, the wording should be amended as appropriate.\nThe possibility of being offered another award, when the Doctorate requirements are not met as a result of failure of the research component, should also be covered at this point.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n24 June 2024||"

Student Staff Fora are the main academic representation and feedback system at the University of Nottingham and are jointly delivered by the University and the Students' Union (UoNSU)This information is relevant to staff and students across the UK campus.For information about the academic representation and feedback systems at the University of Nottingham campuses in Malaysia and China, follow the link below:\nLearning Community Fora (UNNC)\nStudent Staff Fora (UNM)\nPurpose\nThe purposes of the Student Staff Forum (SSF) are to:\nTo ensure that the feedback and concerns of students about their courses of study are discussed and that solutions/actions are co-created by student representatives and academic staff throughout the academic year;\nTo ensure that the views of students are given proper weight in the processes of course and module review;\nTo provide a forum for the exchange of ideas and information between the student body and the School in relation to their education and non-academic welfare.\nTo provide a forum for co-creation around areas of the school, department or division that have been raised.\nThere must be at least one SSF in each school, department or division; all students (including research students) must have an opportunity to contribute to its discussions, with separate Undergraduate and Postgraduate SSF where appropriate. The School, department or division can implement more Student Staff Fora than the minimum requirement, but this must be agreed by staff, student representatives and the Students' Union Student Voice Team before the start of the academic year.\nEssential information\nIncludes\n: general management; agendas, reports and action points\nGeneral\nA Student Staff Forum (SSF) must meet at least three times in a 12-month period.\nEach school, department or division should follow the terms of reference and Student Staff Forum guidance document on the composition of its SSF.\nCourse representatives are responsible for effectively collecting feedback from their fellow students, representing their views at meetings, and disseminating feedback from the meetings. Schools, departments and divisions should help to facilitate this by providing a mechanism for student representatives to email or contact in some other way their fellow students.\nThe Student Staff Forum must be co-chaired by the relevant Senior Course Representative and a staff member in the department, school or division.\nSenior Course Representatives are responsible for collating feedback from the Course Representatives that are assigned to them. This is so that an agenda can be created by the Senior Course Representatives and Staff Co-Chair and distributed before the meeting.\nPlease note that training and development activities for student representatives are managed by the Students’ Union.\nThe Senior Course Representative and the Staff Co-Chair, or their delegates must be in attendance at every meeting. All Course Reps must be invited and should attend unless unable to do so.\nRelevant staff can be invited to individual meetings based on the agenda under the discretion of the Senior Course Representative and the Staff Co-Chair.\nThe school, department or division should display the names and contact details of the representatives on the SSF, SSF Action Logs, external examiner reports and school responses to those reports on an appropriate forum that is clear and readily available to students (such as Moodle).\nAgendas, reports and action points\nThe Senior Course Representative and the Staff Co-Chair set the Student Staff Forum agenda. There should be a simple mechanism for both staff and students to have items placed on the agenda for discussion.\nAll meetings must have an agenda that contains the key topics/issues for co-creation, as well as any other key information that needs to be distributed to and/or through Course Representatives.\nAfter every meeting, and at the end of each Term, an Action Log should be distributed to all students in a school, department or division outlining the actions agreed within the relevant SSF by the Senior Course Representative and relevant University Staff as well as updated progress on each action.\nThe Student Staff Forum Action Log must be taken into consideration in the school's monitoring processes.\nIt is not expected that every action requested by student representatives will be implemented, but it is expected that they should be given proper consideration and the grounds for non-implementation should be explained.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nStudent Staff Forum Action Log Template\nStudent Staff Forum Agenda Template\nStudent Staff Forum Terms of Reference\nStudent Staff Forum Guidance Document\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n01 August 2024||"

        "content": "Partnerships and placements - The University of NottinghamPartnerships and placements\nThis page provides guidance on different types of partnership arrangements, as well as the University's guidelines on placement learning. This information is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses and may also be of interest to external partners.1.0 Purpose\nThe University of Nottingham’s guidelines for the approval of collaborative provision arrangements have been drafted to align with relevant guidance provided by the Quality Assurance Agency. For more detailed information, please consult the relevant page of the QAA website in Section 5 below.\nThe sections \"Approval of partnership arrangements\" to \"Types of collaboration\" (below) only apply to partnerships leading to the award of a University of Nottingham qualification as set out in the University of Nottingham Qualifications Framework (UNQF). For more information about the UNQF, please consult the link below.\nFor information about other types of partnership, please see the section entitled \"Partnerships not leading to a University of Nottingham qualification\" further down this page.\n2.0 Key Principles\nFor all partnership arrangements (as opposed to placement learning opportunities), a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) must be signed on behalf of the University by an authorised member of University Executive Board (UEB) on behalf of Education and Student Experience Committee (ESEC) or (in regard to relevant postgraduate agreements) by Research and Graduate Services.\nTeaching collaborations with other institutions must follow University of Nottingham procedures and approvals to ensure they meet quality standards, regulatory requirements and diligence checks as outlined within the Quality Manual. We will endeavour to conclude agreements so that all campuses are included.\nAll teaching and assessment of students who are registered for a University of Nottingham qualification must be in English. The only exception is where the subject of study is a language or literature other than English.\n2.1 International campuses\nBoth University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) and University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC) award University of Nottingham degrees. As such, the Higher Education (HE) provision is regulated by UK regulators and Malaysian or Chinese HE regulators respectively. UNM and UNNC must therefore meet UK quality standards in addition to any local ones.\n2.2 Types of Collaboration\nThe following types of collaboration constitute an exhaustive list and no other types of collaboration leading to a University of Nottingham qualification (that is to say, franchises and validations) will be permitted.\n2.2.1 Progression\nProgression arrangements enable students who have successfully completed study at one organisation to be considered for entry (individually) onto the beginning of a University of Nottingham programme.\nThe two separate components are the responsibility of the respective organisations delivering them. Students normally have a contractual relationship with the organisation which delivers the first component and subsequently with the University of Nottingham.\n2.2.2 Articulation\nArticulation agreements enable all students who satisfy academic criteria on one programme to be admitted with advanced standing to a subsequent stage of a programme at the University of Nottingham (these are usually 2+2 arrangements but can also be in other forms).\nThese arrangements are subject to formal agreements between the parties and normally involve credit accumulation and transfer, so that credit achieved for the approved study at the first provider is transferred to contribute to the programme and award completed at the University of Nottingham.\nThe two separate components are the responsibility of the respective organisations delivering them but, together, contribute to a single University of Nottingham award. Students normally have a contractual relationship with the organisation which delivers the first component and subsequently with the degree-awarding body.\n2.2.3 Off-campus delivery\nIn an off-campus delivery model, teaching is provided entirely by University of Nottingham staff, but delivery occurs away from any of the University's campuses and the provision of facilities (for example, teaching accommodation, library and IT resources, administrative support and others) is undertaken partly or wholly by the partner institution.\n2.3.4 Joint award\nJoint Award is an arrangement under which two or more awarding bodies together provide a programme leading to a joint award (single certification) made jointly by both, or all, participants, replacing separate institutional or national qualifications.\n2.3.5 Dual award\nThis is an arrangement involving more than one degree awarding body working together to offer a jointly conceived programme but usually designed in a way to enable students to achieve more than one distinct set of criteria.\nA student may not need to satisfy the requirements of all partners to receive an award. Students who successfully complete both programmes receive separate institutional or national certificates, one for each of the two separate qualifications, granted by each of the awarding bodies involved. Those qualifications can be at different levels.\n2.3.6 Joint supervision\nUniversity of Nottingham staff and staff of the partner institution jointly deliver supervision of multiple numbers of postgraduate research students registered with the University of Nottingham and studying for a Nottingham qualification only. This may include some element of off-campus delivery.\nThe additional information available in the Teaching Partnership Handbook outlines the quality assurance issues and financial considerations to be borne in mind when considering whether to establish a partnership arrangement.\n2.3 Partnerships not leading to a University of Nottingham qualification\nThis section applies to teaching-related partnerships that use the University of Nottingham brand but which do not involve the award of a qualification listed in the University of Nottingham Qualifications Framework (UNQF). see below for link.\nSuch partnerships must have a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) or other contractual document that  follows the normal MoA template in all relevant matters, must involve consultation by way of Partnership Operational meetings if University of Nottingham student status is being granted to participants in the partnership, and be approved as follows:\nCPD partnerships of this type must be approved by the Director of Legal Services\nPre-degree foundation or access partnerships must be approved by the Chair of Foundation Year Committee\nAny other partnerships of this type not leading to the award of a University of Nottingham qualification, and not covered above, must be referred to the Quality and Standards team for consideration of the most appropriate signatory.\n2.4 Placement learning\nThe University of Nottingham’s policy for placement learning is intended to be sufficiently broad to cover all types of work-based or study-based arrangements at the University and outlines the minimum requirements which schools and professional services are expected to meet in arrangements for exchange or placement learning.\nIt is not intended to cover learning outside the University which is not a planned part of a programme of study, such as voluntary placements, part-time, term-time and vacation work which students have arranged for themselves. For more information about such activities, please consult the Careers and Employability Service using the link below.\n2.4.1 Types of placement\nWithin the University of Nottingham there are several different types of placement learning for students on undergraduate and postgraduate taught courses. These are:\n2.4.2 Academic placements\nUndertaking study overseas as part of a university or language school programme.\n2.4.3 Work and industrial placements\nTo gain work and industrial experience relevant to the course or aligned to an area of career interest.\n2.4.4 Practice placements\nTo develop the practical skills and competencies that will be required for practice in a profession or other employment.\n2.4.5 Language assistantships\nWorking at a school abroad to improve knowledge of a foreign culture and language.\nThe method of assessment or credit rating of the placement varies between courses and must be outlined in the school guidelines. On some placements students are assessed and gain credits which count to their final award, whilst on other placements there are no credits awarded but completion of the placement is required in order to meet progression requirements.\n2.5 Marks and credit transfer for students on study abroad placements at educational institutions\nWhere students participate in periods of study abroad at another educational institution which result in the award of marks and credit by the partner institution, the University undertakes to provide arrangements for the consistent transfer of credit and marks to Nottingham for the purpose of calculating final degrees.\nThis will ensure that students on international exchanges are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged in relation to peers remaining in Nottingham.\nFor more information, please consult the Credit and Grade Transfer Policy (linked below)\n2.6 Partnership history\nA list of live and historical partnerships is maintained on the Collaborative Provision Register (hosted on Workspace), and linked to below.\n3.0 Standard Operating Procedure - Roles and Responsibilities\n3.1 Roles and Responsibilities for Partnerships\nSee procedural steps section below\n3.2 Roles and Responsibilities for Placements\n3.2.1 Responsibilities of the School\n3.2.1.1 Information for students\nSchools must inform eligible students at an appropriate stage of exchange or placement opportunities offered by the school.\nSchools must ensure that students are adequately informed about the procedures for securing, approving and allocating exchange and placements and if applicable define their procedures and criteria for approval of individual opportunities.\nSchools must ensure that procedures are in place to inform students where requests to undertake exchange or placements have not been approved. Where consultation with professional services departments is required, all involved must be kept fully informed and notified of any outcome.\nSchools must ensure that they have sufficient up-to-date information about each of their partner institutions and placement providers for dissemination to interested students.\nWhere relevant, students must be informed in detail about the programme of language study which is required, and about language study facilities at the University.\nSchools must ensure that students are adequately informed about the academic requirements of the exchange or placement learning period and, if applicable, how the marks obtained will be processed and incorporated into their degree classification.\nStudents must be aware of the procedures for claiming extenuating circumstances.\nStudents must be informed about the consequences of failure to secure or fully attend and complete an exchange or placement.\nLearning Agreements, Practice Action Plans and Student Work Training Approval forms (as appropriate) must be concluded with the student prior to departure.\nIt is good practice for Schools to ensure that students\nare\nadequately informed about any induction and registration procedures at the placement provider or partner institution.\nSchools must ensure that the student is aware of relevant health and safety, insurance, personal safety and cultural information.\nStudents must be provided with full contact details for the members of staff who will be responsible for them during their exchange/placement learning period both in the school and at the placement provider or partner institution.\nStudents must be provided with information about the University’s support services that will remain available to them during the exchange or placement and about the procedures in place if an emergency arises.\nSchools must ensure that students are aware of the University’s complaints procedures and that these must be used if students wish to make a complaint regarding their exchange or placement.\n3.2.1.2 Information to staff\nSchools must ensure that staff responsible for exchange or placement learning activities are adequately trained to meet the needs of their role.\nPlacement providers and partner institutions must be informed of the mechanism for making complaints.\nSchools must ensure that the placement provider or partner institution has been provided with information about the student by the deadline required by the placement provider or partner institution.\nSchools must ensure that Registy and Academic Affairs or equivalent and the Global Oppertunities team have been informed of the students who will be undertaking a study abroad exchange period or placement and that these offices are notified immediately of any subsequent changes\n.\n3.2.1.3 Regarding the rights and responsibilities of students\nSchools must inform students of their responsibilities:\nTo maintain contact with their home school and tutor or study abroad contact (as appropriate) in accordance with any agreed arrangements prior to commencement of the exchange or placement;\nAs representatives of the University;\nTowards the placement provider or partner institution and its customers, clients, patients, service users, employees and the general public. This can include complying with the laws of the host country to which they will be subject during their stay, maintaining appropriate dress or uniform code and maintaining punctuality, reliability and professional conduct;\nFor managing their learning and professional relationships;\nFor recording their progress and achievements;\nFor alerting the placement provider or partner institution and their home school to problems with the exchange or placement that might prevent the progress or satisfactory completion of the exchange or placement.\nSchools must inform students of their rights:\nTo a safe exchange or placement environment;\nTo the existence of any support services available to them during their stay in the host country; and\nTo be treated in accordance with applicable legislation.\n3.2.1.4 Information for students who have a disability\nSchools have a responsibility to ensure that the needs of students who have a disability and who are participating in exchanges or placements are considered to departure and that appropriate support is available before, during and after their placements.\n3.2.1.5 Regarding the responsibilities of placement providers and partner institutions\nSchools must be able to assure themselves that placement providers and partner institutions know what their responsibilities are during the period of exchange or placement learning including their roles in providing appropriate learning opportunities, the assessment of students and the health and safety of students.\nPlacement providers and partner institutions must also be informed of the mechanism for making complaints.\n4.0 Standard Operating Procedure - Procedural Steps\n4.1 Approval of partnership arrangements\nThe University has a three-stage approach to approval and review of teaching partnerships and formulation of Memoranda of Agreement (MoA) as follows:\n4.1.1 Stage 1 – Approval of partner\nApproval of all partners and partnerships is subject to support being received from the relevant Head of School(s) and, in the case of partnerships involving University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) or University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC), the relevant Vice-Provost(s) for Teaching and Learning.\nIf certain criteria are met, the approval of the partner will be automatic. For all other cases within the UK, the approval of the partner must be given by the relevant Associate Pro-Vice Chancellor (APVC).\nFor partnerships involving only an international campus, the role of APVC will be undertaken by an equivalent representative (on that campus) in consultation with the Vice-Provost for Teaching and Learning and the International Partnerships team in the UK. This approval will be granted on the basis of consideration of a Partnership Concept Paper (PCP) prepared by the International Partnerships team and/or the relevant school.\n4.1.2 Stage 2 – Discussion of the basis for the partnership and formulation of Memoranda of Agreement\nThe depth of scrutiny involved in approval of the basis for the partnership will vary depending on the type of partnership and whether it was necessary for a Partnership Concept Paper (PCP) to be considered.\nPlease be aware that templates already exist for standard regulatory, quality assurance, administrative, financial and legal arrangements for each of the types of partnerships.\nSchools will liaise with the International Partnerships team (for international partnerships) or Student Services Development (for home partnerships) to draft a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA), using those templates.\nFor partnerships involving an international campus only, the role of UK professional services departments will be undertaken by the equivalent units on that campus, under the supervision of the Vice-Provost for Teaching and Learning.\nDuring the final stages of development, documentation will be presented at the tri-campus Partnerships Operational Meeting for comment – this will include representatives from other professional services from the relevant campuses – for example, Student Services Delivery, Curriculum, Admissions, Specialists Processes, Graduate School, and Quality and Standards.\n4.1.3 Stage 3 – University level approval by Quality and Standards Committee\nFollowing consultation at the Partnerships Operational meeting, Student Services Development (Academic Processes) will provide the Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with a commentary containing background information about the proposed arrangement, as well as any supporting documentation, to a relevant representative of Quality and Standards Committee (QSC).\nIf satisfied, the QSC member will:\nRecommend to the Pro-Vice Chancellor (PVC) for Global Engagement for international partnership or;\nRecommend to the PVC for Education and Student Experience (or other authorised member of the University's Executive Board (UEB)) for home partnership or;\nRecommend to Research and Graduate Services (in regard to relevant postgraduate agreements); that the MoA be signed.\nIf substantial quality and standards issues are deemed to exist, the member of QSC may choose to refer the matter to the whole committee. Once a recommendation to approve the MoA has been made by QSC, the International Partnerships team will arrange for the signing of international MoAs and another relevant professional service (for example, either Research and Graduate Services or Research and Innovation) will undertake this role in the case of UK MoAs.\nFor more information about QSC, please consult the Quality and Standards Committee page linked below.\n4.1.4 Reviews of partnership\nPartnership programmes are subject to annual monitoring and Periodic Assurance and Continous Enhancement Reviews (PACERs) in the same manner as the University’s other programmes. In addition, the partnership is subject to review whenever a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) requires renewal (the maximum period for an MoA is five years).\nFor MoAs lasting less than three years, a renewal review is not needed if the initial approval or a review has occurred within the last three years. Further information about renewal reviews for MoAs is available from the Teaching Partnership Handbook.\nFor more information about our monitoring processes, please consult the Programme monitoring and review (linked below)\n4.2 Approval for Placement learning\n4.2.1 Approval of placement providers\nResources have been made available to help staff with setting up and obtaining approval for exchange programmes and placements, including the Student Services Documentation Hub, an area of Workspace and the University of Nottingham Safety Office – Placements webpage.\nThis covers the considerations to be taken into account when establishing a new exchange or placement, including the need to undertake a risk assessment for the potential exchange or placement at the outset and ensure the school can provide appropriate support and information for the assistance of students planning to undertake an exchange or placement.\nTo access the Partnership development Workspace, please use the following link (entering your university username and password when prompted):\nFor more information about placement considerations, please consult the Safety Office Website, Placements section (see link below)\nSchools must ensure that appropriate internal mechanisms are in place to monitor and evaluate placement providers and partner institutions and the learning opportunities offered. These due diligence procedures will be proportionate to the complexity and volume of the exchange or placement provision being offered.\n4.2.2 Pre-placement preparation\nStudents who undertake a UK based placement off campus during their studies will be hosted by a placement provider, e.g. the NHS for health sciences students. Students on placement are expected to adhere to the policies and practices of their host organisation and the requirements of workplace based assessments, including specified working days and working hours. As part of pre-placement preparation within Schools and at the placement provider, students will be advised on Equality, Diversity and Inclusion issues within the workplace, legal requirements of the placement provider and issues around the dignity of the customer/patient.\nStudents undertaking placement work overseas will also receive preparation on the cultural expectations and differences in the host environment. Students are strongly advised to make themselves aware of the different cultural context in which they will be required to undertake their learning, assessment or research.\n4.2.3 Adjustment to placement on religious grounds\nStudents wishing to request an adjustment to their placement on religious grounds must contact their home School at the earliest possible opportunity, and prior to the start of the placement, to discuss this. It will then be for the home School to assess and approve any adjustment and to liaise with the placement provider as necessary.\nThe placement provider will take account of business needs and current policies and practices in reaching a decision and it cannot be assumed that the placement provider will grant permission. In some cases it will not be possible, due to legitimate reasons, for a religious observance request to be granted yet still necessary for a student to continue in the placement or with other work related learning.\n4.3 General Principles\nSchools must include information about exchange or placement learning in their programme specifications for relevant courses. This must include intended learning outcomes (which must be related to the programme learning outcomes) monitoring and review procedures and methods of assessment.\nThe school must consider whether any assessment of exchange or placement learning is covered by their arrangements for internal moderation and external examining and whether the standards which are applied to any assessment of exchange or placement learning are consistent with available subject benchmarks and other relevant reference points and, where appropriate, fulfil professional or regulatory body requirements. Agreements with placement providers and partner institutions must also include information on requirements (academic or otherwise) for passing the placement, and consequences of failure.\nWhere the exchange or placement learning is replacing learning that would otherwise take place within the University, schools must ensure that by the end of their studies the students will have achieved the learning outcomes set out in the relevant programme specification. It is therefore necessary for schools to assure themselves that the choice of subjects taken during the exchange or placement enables the integrity of the programme to be maintained as well as ensuring that the level and volume of study and the assessment of it warrants the award of the same number of credits as are being missed at the University.\nWhere the partner institution or placement provider does not offer learning that delivers required learning outcomes that are not met by other parts of the student's programme, the school may require the student to undertake additional work during their exchange or placement or to take particular modules on their return to the University to achieve those learning outcomes. Any constraints on the allowed learning during a period of exchange or placement must be clearly stated in the relevant programme specification.\n4.3.1 During placement learning\nAll schools must:\nrequire students to keep in regular contact with the school during their placement period in order to review their progress. This could be facilitated by e-mail communication. In addition it is recommended that academics or other agreed members of staff within the school or professional services department aim to visit students during the placement period.\nGive students information about their subsequent period of study back at the University, particularly any regulation changes.\n4.3.2 Post-exchange or placement learning\nAll Schools must:\nmonitor and periodically review their exchange and placement policies and procedures in order to evaluate their effectiveness in providing intended learning outcomes and meeting appropriate levels of quality and standards.\nseek formal or informal feedback from the partner institution or placement provider.\nIt is good practice to:\nencourage students to write a brief evaluation of their experiences at the partner institution or placement provider and country (if applicable) in order to provide user-friendly advice for future students.\nconsider holding information events for future students, using the returning students, and consider asking returners to help integrate incoming students from partner institutions.\nremind students to complete reports, receipts and contracts relating to the student grant as applicable\n4.4 Marks and credit transfer for students on study abroad placements at educational institutions\nWhile the management of the credit transfer process is the responsibility of Student Services, schools are responsible for carrying out the mark translation using the approved translation tables. Oversight of the processes is devolved to the Credit and Grade Translation Committee (CGTC) which is a sub-committee of Quality and Standards Committee (QSC).\n4.4.1 Setting up agreements\nThe ownership of an exchange scheme or approval of a university wide partner for student exchange  rests at School level. It is good practice for School Teaching Committees (or equivalent) to play a role in the development of links and the approval of the workload of individual students.\nWhen developing exchange agreements at a School level, Schools must follow the guidelines/regulations issued by Student Services and submit a Quality Assurance Checklist as part of the Due Diligence process. Where an exchange scheme is being established with a new host university (i.e. one with no history of exchanges with University of Nottingham), the Quality Assurance Checklist as part of the Due Diligence process will record the assessment process at the partner and resit process, as applicable. This will be reported to the CGTC with reference to approved policies in the destination country and a proposed mark translation table.\n4.4.2 Credit and Grade Transfer Committee\nThe Credit and Grade Transfer Committee (CGTC) is a sub-committee of QSC. The committee’s remit is to review the operation of the credit transfer process, including the detailed scrutiny of the conversion tables and to receive reports from Exam Boards. Schools and Student Services may refer any issues that arise from their application (and any other aspect of the policy) with a view to updating the tables as appropriate. The CGTC will be chaired by a member of QSC and have representation from each Faculty and from all three campuses. The CGTC will report on its activity to the October meeting of QSC.\n4.4.3 Credit equivalence\nAll schools must define and document the amount of work to be undertaken by the student at the exchange institution which corresponds most closely to the number of credits required for that period of academic study at Nottingham.\nThis must be done by referring to the published guidelines of the CGTC and referring any queries to Student Services.\n4.4.4 Mark translation\nStudent Services will support the work of CGTC by maintaining a mark translation table for each host institution and the use of these tables in converting the unit marks supplied by the host into marks to be returned for the student’s record is now mandatory. Schools are responsible for applying these translation tables to generate marks for each student. These marks must be approved by the appropriate Examination Board.\nWhere an Examination Board believes that the application of the translation table produces an unfair outcome for an individual student or group of students, they must make a case to QSC to allow an outcome outside of regulations.\nSchools must submit an annual report to the CGTC describing any issues arising from the application of the credit & grade transfer process. This report must include:\nsuggestions (with justification) for modifications to the mark translation tables;\nany concerns around the handling of extenuating circumstances by the host institution;\nany practical issues that arise from re-assessment of failed modules;\nany other issues that may require changes to the terms of the exchange agreement.\nA standard report pro-forma will be provided to School Examinations Officers by Student Services.\n4.4.5 Extenuating Circumstances\nSchools must ensure that host institutions report on how any extenuating circumstances (EC) experienced by students on an exchange have been dealt with. These reports must be considered by a School EC panel. If the actions taken by the host institution are not considered to be appropriate by the EC panel, they may recommend further remediation in line with the University’s EC policy. In exceptional cases where this is still felt to lead to an unfair outcome for the student, a case to QSC must be made for an outcome outside of regulations to be allowed. The relevant Board of Examiners must be made aware of the existence of such extenuating circumstances and the remediation agreed.\n4.4.6 Student Learning Agreements\nSchools must ensure that each student undertaking an exchange has an individual Learning Agreement that is approved by the School and the student prior to their final commitment to undertaking the exchange.\nLearning Agreements must include the following elements:\na. A link to the conversion tables(s) to be used.\nb. An explicit allocation of University of Nottingham credits to each module (or equivalent) to be taken at the host institution. It is good practice for students attending the same host institution to undertake a broadly equivalent workload to other Nottingham exchange students in the same subject area. Students who are spending one semester at an exchange institution normally take a minimum of 50 and a maximum of 70 credits worth of courses or modules at that institution.\nc. Clear identification of any modules that will be treated as non-compensatable.\nd. Clear information on the way that extenuating circumstances will be dealt with if they arise during the placement including links to the host institution’s relevant policies and a requirement to copy any correspondence (claims, outcomes etc) arising from the use of those policies to a named member of staff in the home school.\ne. Clear information on re-assessment opportunities available if a fail mark be returned by the host institution. This must include, where appropriate, links to the host institution’s re-assessment policies. The available options for re-assessment are:\ni. the re-assessment(s) are set, taken and marked by the host institution during the period of the exchange (requires the prior approval of the host institution);\nii. the re-assessment(s) are set and marked by the host institution but taken at the University of Nottingham after the end of the exchange (requires the prior approval of the host institution);\niii. the re-assessments(s) are set and marked by the student’s home school after the end of the exchange;\niv. the student is required to enrol on a substitute module at University of Nottingham in order to accrue the credits not gained during the placement. This may entail the student enrolling on extra credits during the next stage of their programme in order to complete the previous stage. Alternatively, it may mean that the student is unable to progress to the next stage until the requisite credits have been gained by taking the substitute module(s) as a part-time student.\nGuidance on drafting Student Learning Agreements will be provided by the Global Engagement team.\n4.4.7 Recording of credits and marks\nThe school must inform the Assessments Teams within Student Services of the allocation of credits to be taken by each individual student for the purposes of module registration and marks processing.\nThis must be done by completing the Credit Transfer Form. ‘Credit Transfer' modules will be created in the student record and assigned the appropriate amount of credit. The credit values of the modules must equate to Nottingham credit values (minimum of 10, and then multiples of 5).\nWhen completing your credit transfer, please use the Credit Transfer Form (linked below)\nSchools must arrive at a single mark for each unit of work (module equivalent) studied abroad. The marks must be recorded against the credit equivalent modules taken at the partner institution.\nPlease be aware that these will not apply to work and industrial\nplacements.\n5.0 Related regulations, policies and procedures\nUK Quality Code, Advice and Guidance: Partnerships\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework\nCareers and Employability Service\nCredit and Grade Transfer Policy\nCollaborative provision register – Workspace\nTo access the Workspace, please use the following link (entering your university username and password when prompted).\nQuality and Standards Committee\nProgramme monitoring and review\nPartnership development – Workspace\nTo access the Workspace, please use the following link (entering your university username and password when prompted).\nUniversity of Nottingham Safety Office Website – Placements\nCredit Transfer Form\n6.0 Version control table\nVersion control table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nReformatted to align with new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework based on content last modified on 03 November 2023.\nQSC\nAugust 2024\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n03 September 2024||"

Identification of training needs\nIncludes:\nrole of the Head of School; consideration of planning and timetabling\nIt is the responsibility of Heads of Schools, in conjunction with supervisors and School Postgraduate Student Advisers (SPSAs), to identify the training needs for individual students, to ensure that these needs are met and to determine the means by which they are met.\nIt is recognised that needs will vary according to the student’s registration status (MPhil or doctoral, full-time or part-time) and according to each individual student’s previous experience. The training needs of part-time students should be considered in planning and timetabling, and they should be encouraged to participate in suitable courses.\nFor more information about the SPSAs, please consult the following:\nResponsibilities of the Postgraduate Student Advisor\n4. Subject-specific training\nIncludes:\nSchool requirements; responsibility of the School\nStudents must satisfy the School’s requirements for research training. Failure to do so may result in the submission of an unsatisfactory annual report to the Head of School.\nIt is the responsibility of a student’s School to provide subject-specific training by means of, for example, attendance at taught theory or practical courses (either undergraduate or postgraduate), seminars, colloquia, conferences, etc.\nAt UNM students must have undertaken a research methodology course (which must encompass the broad approaches, methods and analyses in the field or discipline) or show evidence of attendance of any equivalent courses which support research in the field.\nSchools should decide and inform the student at the outset of the training whether or not the student’s knowledge will be formally assessed at the conclusion of any subject-specific training.\n5. Generic training\nIncludes:\nprovision by the Researcher Academy; researcher development framework; central short courses\nIt is the responsibility of the Researcher Academy to provide training and development ​opportunities which span the needs of different disciplines. This provision will address the requirements identified by the Research Councils and Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) in the Researcher Development Framework. Normally the training and development training will not be formally assessed.\nStudents can download certificates confirming their attendance at courses and workshops run by the Researcher Academy and other University training providers such as Health and Safety from the Central Short Courses website. The Researcher Academy will provide Schools with annual attendance information on students registered within the School.\nFor more information about Central Short Courses, please consult the following:\nAbout Central Short Courses\n6.

This information is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.1. Policy\nEvery research student should have reasonable access to the study facilities and equipment which are necessary to, and which will facilitate, the successful completion of their research studies.\nNote:\nDue to Covid-19 working practices there may be a need to reduce and manage access to research facilities, equipment and study spaces. An individual PGR's needs and access to research facilities will be managed through local prioritisation processes against clear criteria. Where changes in plans are required, supervisory teams will support PGRs to adopt alternative approaches that enable them to address the doctoral outcomes and progression requirements.\n2. Ensure resources are available\nPrior to the commencement of a research degree, the School should establish that the essential resources and facilities will be available when the student begins their research.\nThese resources and facilities may be offered either within the School or elsewhere within the University or (by agreement) in another institution or outside laboratory - and the student and supervisor shall have reasonable access to them.\nNote:\nIf, as a result of Covid-19 restrictions on building occupancy and access to research facilities, it is likely that the required resources and facilities will not be available for use by a new PGR at the point when they are scheduled to commence their research degree, discussions should take place between the supervisor and PGR. These should consider the timeframe over which the resources will become available, what alternative research activity is possible in the interim and whether it would be appropriate for the PGR to defer entry.\n3. If resources become unavailable\nIf in exceptional circumstances it becomes impossible to continue to provide these resources (for example, when a sponsor unexpectedly withdraws funding or equipment), the School should make reasonable efforts to identify alternative means of enabling the student to gain access to suitable facilities so that they may continue their studies at Nottingham.\nHowever, this may mean that in some circumstances it may be necessary to advise that the student carries on their research work in co-operation with another institution.\nNote:\nIf in exceptional circumstances access to specific resources and facilities is reduced or limited in capacity (for example, due to Covid-19 working practices) a local prioritisation process will be used to manage access to these. This may mean that in some circumstances, the PGR is unable to make as extensive use of these facilities and resources as they had originally planned. In such situations, supervisory teams will support PGRs to make changes to their research design and plans in order that they can address the doctoral outcomes and progression requirements.\n4. Study space\nSchools should ensure that a full-time research student (prior to entering the thesis pending period) should have an appropriate individual study space where the student can work and keep their books.\nNote:\nDue to Covid-19 occupancy levels and restrictions, access to on-campus study spaces will be limited and PGRs will be expected to undertake work from home/alternative locations wherever possible. Access to study spaces may need to be booked in advance.\n5. Access to other facilities\nResearch students should also have reasonable access to the following. In some cases it may be possible to cover the costs from research grants relevant to the students' work:\n5.1\nComputing facilities: School or open-access University computing facilities. The opening hours of the University facility should be advertised in Schools and local arrangements concerning access to School facilities should be listed in the School Handbook.\n5.2\nPrinting: Schools should offer a minimum of £50 p.a. to full-time research students and £25 p.a. to part-time research students to assist with the cost of draft printing for required reports.\n5.3\nPhotocopying: Schools should offer a minimum of £50 p.a. to full-time research students and £25 p.a. to part-time research students to assist with photocopying costs.\n5.4\nInter-library loans: Schools should offer a minimum of £50 p.a to full-time research students and £25 p.a. to part-time research students to assist with inter-library loans.\n5.5\nTelephones: Students should have access to a telephone which permits internal telephone calls and in-coming external calls.\n5.6\nRecreational area: where sufficient space has been provided to a School by the University, and where there is no suitable University or Students’ Union facility in the vicinity, the School should provide a recreational area. This need not be dedicated to research students but might be shared with other students and staff.\n5.7\nOther student services: The University will provide a range of other student services. For example, the Researcher Academy, the Accommodation Service, the Counselling Service, and the Centre for English Language Education.\nAdditional links (to key services)\nResearcher Academy\nAccommodation services\nThe University Counselling Services\nCentre for English Language Education\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nGraduate School - PGR\nGS-PGR@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n18 June 2024||"

Introduction\nIncludes:\nPolicy on support for pregnant students and students with very young children document\n1.1\nThis policy relates to the payment of postgraduate research studentship maintenance stipends during periods of maternity leave, paternity/maternity support leave, shared parental leave and adoption leave and applies to eligible postgraduate research students listed in 2.1 of the section below.\n1.2\nThis policy should be read in conjunction with the Policy on support for pregnant students and students with very young children. Students should also refer to the Voluntary Interruption of Study and Extension to Thesis pending Policies specified in the Quality Manual, which can be found here:\nPolicy on support for pregnant students and students with very young children\nVoluntary interruption of study\nThesis pending period (including policy on extension)\n2. Postgraduate research student eligibility criteria for receiving maternity leave, paternity/maternity support leave, shared parental leave, and adoption leave stipend payments\n2.1\nPostgraduate research students in receipt of annual maintenance stipend funding from the following sources are eligible to receive stipend payments under this policy:\na)\nStudents who receive Research Council funded maintenance stipends;\nb)\nStudents who receive University of Nottingham funded maintenance stipends.\n2.2\nStudents are eligible:\na)\nWhether registered on a full-time or part-time basis;\nb)\nFrom the point of initial registration on their programme;\nc)\nWhere the first day of the period of leave falls within the funded period, or in the case of maternity leave where the expected date of delivery (EDD)* falls within the funded period, and for adoption leave where the date of adoption falls within the funded period;\n* Referred to as ‘expected week of confinement’ in the Maternity Certificate (MAT B1) issued by a doctor or midwife.\nd)\nTo receive stipend payments under this policy on multiple occasions.\n2.3\nStudents who are funded from external sources administered by the University of Nottingham, may be eligible for some or all of the above type of payment subject to their funders’ terms and conditions.\n2.4\nThe following groups of students are not eligible for receipt of stipend payments under this policy:\na)\nSelf-funded students;\nb)\nPostgraduate research students who receive an externally funded stipend directly from an external organisation. Such students must follow the processes of their funder. If the funder does not provide additional funds, the University is not liable to provide any payments under this policy. As such students are advised to carefully check the terms and conditions attached to their funding prior to accepting that funding, and to refer back to those terms and conditions as necessary;\nc)\nStudents in receipt of bursaries or awards covering tuition fees only;\nd)\nStudents who have been in receipt of funding (as specified in 2.2 above), but who are, or will be, outside of their funding period at the point at which their period of leave would commence.\n2.5\nStudents who fall into the categories in 2.4 above, and who have financial concerns about taking a period of maternity leave, paternity/maternity support leave, shared parental leave or adoption leave are advised to contact the Student Funding and Financial Support team or Students’ Union for advice and support. Please note in all maternity cases, students will have to interrupt their studies for 2 weeks post-birth.\n3. Types of leave\nIncludes:\nmaternity and adoption; paternity/maternity support; shared parental\n3.1\nMaternity and adoption leave:\nStudents are entitled to up to 52 weeks of maternity and adoption leave.\na)\nThe first 26 weeks will be paid at the student’s usual stipend rate;*\n* Referred to as ‘expected week of confinement’ in the Maternity Certificate (MAT B1) issued by a doctor or midwife.\nb)\nThe following 13 weeks will be paid at the Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) rate as advised on the Gov.UK website at the start of the maternity leave;\nc)\nA further period of up to 13 weeks, which will be unpaid;\nd)\nThe paid and unpaid periods of leave must be taken consecutively.\n3.2\nPaternity/maternity support leave:\na)\nStudents are entitled to up to 10 days of leave at the usual stipend rate.** These may be taken at any time during a partner's pregnancy or within three months following the birth;\n** The full stipend rate is stipulated on the student’s offer or award letter, however, where a student has changed their registration status subsequent to this (e.g. changed from full-time to part-time registration) stipend payments under this policy will reflect the amount of stipend they were receiving in accordance with their registration status at the point at which an application for a period of interruption to cover a period of maternity, shared parental or adoption leave is made. Students should consult Student Services to check the arrangements for their individual award.\nb)\nThose entitled to this leave include the spouse, civil partner or partner of the person giving birth or primary adopter, who will share responsibility for the child’s upbringing.\n3.3\nShared parental leave:\nStudents are entitled to up to 50 weeks of Shared parental leave.\n(a)\nThe first 24 weeks will be paid at the full stipend rate;\n(b)\nThe following 13 weeks will be paid at 41% of the full stipend rate;\n(c)\nA further period of up to 13 weeks which will be unpaid.\n(d)\nThose entitled to share parental leave are the person giving birth to the baby/the primary adopter and their spouse, civil partner or partner, who will share responsibility for the child’s upbringing.\nThese levels are commensurate with employee entitlements.\n4. Identification of eligibility\nIncludes:\nreference to funding offer letter; conflict\nStudents should refer to their funding offer letter and terms and conditions specified in it. Where there is a conflict between the eligibility criteria specified in this policy and the terms and conditions set out in a student’s offer or award letter, the terms and conditions set out in the offer or award letter take precedence, unless there is a clear conflict with the eligibility criteria specified in sections above, which would lead to a student being treated less advantageously than other students in receipt of comparable funding.\nWhere offer and award letters do not make specific reference to eligibility (which may be the case in some instances for students who entered prior to the 2018/19 academic year) the criteria specified in this policy should determine whether a student is eligible for receipt of stipend payments under this policy.\nIn any instance where a student’s eligibility is not clear, the relevant School’s Student Service Centre should be consulted in the first instance.\n5. Process for application for a period of funded leave\nIncludes:\nmaternity, shared parental and adoption; paternity/maternity support\n5.1\nMaternity, shared parental and adoption leave:\nA student must apply for a period of voluntary interruption to their study of the relevant length. This needs to have been approved in order for their maintenance funding and period of registered study to be extended commensurately. For more information, please consult the following:\nVoluntary interruption of study\nPostgraduate research maintenance stipend funding for approved periods of maternity, shared parental or adoption leave will be made to eligible students to cover the period of interruption for maternity, shared parental or adoption leave as specified in section 3 (Types of leave).\nStudents may be required to supply evidence to support the request for stipend funding under this policy. Sources of evidence will normally be those set out under the equivalent staff procedure. Students may also be required to provide sufficient notice of their intention to take a period of interruption on these grounds. For example, to apply for shared parental leave a student must give notice at least 8 weeks prior to the period of interruption, and as such students should discuss their intentions with their supervisor as early as possible.\nPolicy on support for pregnant students and students with very young children\n5.2\nPaternity/maternity support leave:\nAs the length for this leave is a maximum of 10 days, students will not normally be required to apply for a period of voluntary interruption of study, nor will their period of registered study and maintenance payments be automatically extended. However, if an extension to the expected submission date is required students may apply using the relevant policies. To be eligible for an extension in these circumstances a student must have disclosed their intention to take paternity/maternity support at the appropriate time.\n6. Confidentiality\nStudents should note that every effort will be made to respect the confidential nature of any disclosure of information on these grounds.\nHowever, in order to manage financial arrangements with regard to stipend payments during a period of leave, the University may need to disclose to external funders that the student has notified the University of their intention of applying for a period of interruption, which would result in payment of maintenance stipends under this policy.\n7. Returning from a period of funded leave\nIncludes:\nstudents who receive stipend payments; exceptional circumstances; failure to return\nStudents who receive stipend payments for periods of maternity, shared parental or adoption leave under this policy are expected to return to registered study.\nHowever, it is recognised that in exceptional circumstances this may not be possible, in which case there is a minimum requirement to provide a detailed handover of their work to their supervisors immediately following the period of leave.\nThe University may reclaim all or part of the payment if the student fails to return to registered study or undertake such handover following the period of leave.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nGraduate School - PGR\nGS-PGR@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n20 June 2024||"

Student eligibility criteria for receiving sick pay\nIncludes:\nfunding implications\n2.1\nPostgraduate research students in receipt of annual maintenance stipend funding from the following sources are eligible to receive stipend payments under this policy:\na)\nStudents who receive Research Council funded maintenance stipends;\nb)\nStudents who receive University of Nottingham funded maintenance stipends.\n2.2\nStudents are eligible:\na)\nWhether registered on a full-time or part-time basis;\nb)\nFrom the point of initial registration on their programme;\nc)\nTo receive stipend payments under this policy on multiple occasions subject to the terms below.\n2.3\nStudents who are funded from external sources administered by the University of Nottingham, may be eligible for some or all of the above type of payment subject to their Funders’ terms and conditions.\n2.4\nThe following groups of students are not eligible for receipt of stipend payments under this policy:\na)\nSelf-funded students;\nb)\nPostgraduate research students who receive an externally funded stipend directly from an external organisation. These students must follow the regulations of their funder. If the funder does not provide additional funds, the University is not liable to provide any payments under this policy. As such students are advised to carefully check the terms and conditions attached to their funding prior to accepting that funding, and to refer back to those terms and conditions as necessary;\nc)\nStudents in receipt of bursaries or awards covering tuition fees only;\nd)\nStudents who have been in receipt of funding (as specified in 2.1a and 2.1b above), but who are or will be outside of their funded period at the point at which their period of leave would commence.\n3. Eligibility criteria for receiving sick pay\nIncludes:\nduration; retrospective requests for sick pay\nEligible students may receive up to 13 weeks of paid sick leave at their normal stipend value from the first day of certified illness within any 12 month period subject to the following criteria:\na)\nStudents are not entitled to paid sick leave during the thesis pending period or any resubmission period;\nb)\nAll cases of student sick leave will be considered individually on a case by case basis and any payment is subject to the approval of the relevant School, Faculty or Doctoral Training programme;\nc)\nIn the case of short-term, self-limiting illnesses lasting less than four weeks (eg. colds, stomach upsets) stipend payments will continue to be paid.\nd)\nIf the period of illness exceeds four weeks, the student will be required to formally interrupt their studies (see section 5 below). Any stipend payments already made to such students will be accounted for as sick pay from the date the student reported that their illness started, not the date any request for an interruption to study is made. Sick pay is unlikely to be considered if the absence due to illness is not reported at the time using the procedure in section 4c (Procedure for reporting sickness) below.\ne)\nRetrospective requests for sick pay will not normally be considered.\n4. Procedure for reporting sickness\nIncludes:\nnotification of supervisor; durations; returning to study; calculating an absence period\na)\nAny period of absence owing to illness, accident or injury should be reported by the student to the supervisor(s).\nb)\nFor absence of 7 days or less, students are required to provide self-certification of their illness by completing the relevant form available from Student Service Centres, and must be submitted on the day of return to the University to the appropriate Student Service Centre.\nc)\nFor absence greater than 7 days, students are required to have a medical certificate, available via their General Practitioner, covering any further periods of sickness in the same absence period. Students must complete the reverse side of the certificate before submission to the appropriate Student Service Centre.\nd)\nThe student will not normally be permitted to return to their studies before the date specified by the doctor on the medical certificate.\ne)\nWhen calculating an absence period, note that weekends and public holidays are counted as days of absence.\n5. Interruption of studies due to sickness during the period of registered study\nIn line with existing University policies (referenced above in section 1):\na)\nIf the period of illness exceeds 4 weeks, the student will be required to formally interrupt their studies.\nb)\nIf the absence is for a period of more than 2 weeks or any period considered to be significant by the School and notified to students, the School may require the student to suspend their studies and return at a specified time in the future that will enable the student to resume the programme appropriately (see paragraph 2.1.4 of the Regulations Governing Attendance and Engagement).\nc)\nThe University normally permits postgraduate research students to interrupt their degree for a maximum period of 12 months in total throughout the duration of the degree. To apply for an interruption, please consult the following:\nVoluntary interruption of study\nd)\nAny application for an interruption of studies due to sickness is granted at the discretion of the appropriate School or Faculty and must be accompanied by a medical certificate or other acceptable evidence as defined in the relevant policies.\n6. Returning to study after sick leave\nIncludes:\nwhom to inform; postponed return; additional support consultations\na)\nStudents must keep their supervisor and appropriate School, Faculty and/or Student Service Centre informed of any changes in their circumstances that may result in them returning to their studies earlier or later than originally stated.\nb)\nStudents who are interrupting and want to return to their studies later than originally stated must apply for an extension to their interruption and provide a new medical certificate.\nc)\nThe Student Services Welfare Officer and/or the Disability Support Office should be consulted if additional support needs are required for students returning from long-term sick leave. Students may in certain circumstances be referred to Occupational Health before being allowed to return to study.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nGraduate School - PGR\nGS-PGR@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n20 June 2024||"

Its content is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.1. Policy\nEvery postgraduate researcher (PGR) registered for a higher degree (PhD, professional doctorate) will be guided during their period of registered study by a team of supervisors with suitable academic qualifications, appropriate expertise in the agreed area of the candidate’s research topic and an acceptable level of supervision experience.\n2. Ensuring adequacy of supervision\nIncludes:\nresponsibility of Head of School; requirements for admission of PGRs\nHeads of Schools are responsible for arranging for PGRs in their School to receive appropriate and continuous supervision during their period of registered study.\nA PGR should only be admitted if the Head of School is satisfied that:\nthere are members of staff in the School suitably academically qualified for the task and who have the academic expertise and supervisory experience to supervise the PGR;\nthe members of staff are willing to supervise the PGR and the candidate is willing to accept them as their supervisors;\nthe member of staffs’ other teaching and research commitments permit them to accept the additional supervisory role;\nthe members of staff are aware of the role and responsibilities of supervisors;\nthe members of staff have received appropriate advice/training in supervision skills.\nThe Head of School should also be satisfied that the above conditions are met for all members of the supervisory team including those from outside the School.\n3. Supervisory Team\nIncludes:\nallocation; appointing joint or lead supervisors; responsibilities; availability\nPGRs will be allocated a supervisory team containing at least 2 co-supervisors. This should normally occur prior to the PGR commencing their studies, but failing that and in exceptional circumstances supervisors must be allocated within 4 weeks of the commencement of their studies.\nAt least one member of the supervisory team will be currently engaged in research in the relevant discipline(s), so as to ensure that the direction and monitoring of the candidate’s progress is informed by up to date subject knowledge and research developments. The other member(s) need not necessarily have relevant discipline expertise, so long as the breadth of experience and knowledge across the supervisory team means that the candidates will always have access to someone with experience of supporting PGRs through to successful completion of their programme.\nOne of the supervisors in a co-supervisory arrangement must be designated as the lead supervisor and act as the main point of contact between the University and the PGR. The respective roles and responsibilities of the lead and other members of the supervisory team should be agreed and the candidate advised.\nMore information on the role of the supervisor can be found here:\nResponsibilities of the supervisor\nIf one of the co-supervisors is absent from the University at any point during the period of registration, and this period of absence exceeds 6 months, an alternative supervisor should be appointed at the earliest opportunity. If it is the lead supervisor who is absent, it should be agreed which member of the supervisory team will cover their responsibilities during the absence and the candidate should be advised. In the event of short periods of supervisor absence, supervisions should continue as required with the remaining member(s) of the supervisory team.\n4. Subject expertise\nSupervisors must have an appropriate level of joint expertise between them in the academic area of the candidate’s research.\n5. PGR agreement to supervision arrangements\nIncludes:\nresearch opportunities; responsibilities of the Head of School\nResearch opportunities may be identified separately by supervisors, a candidate or a sponsor, or following discussions between a sponsor and the supervisors or a sponsor and the candidate. The key element linking the PGR and supervisors must be interest in and appropriate knowledge of the proposed area of research. There should be mutual agreement on the specific research topic, following discussions between the parties.\nThe Head of School should involve both the PGR and the members of staff in the preliminary discussions about supervision and should seek their agreement to initial supervision arrangements. A form is available for use by Schools to notify changes to the supervision arrangements for a PGR (see below), to be signed by the candidate, supervisors and the Head of School. Registry and Academic Affairs (or equivalent) should always be notified in writing of changes to supervision arrangements and this will act as confirmation that the PGR has agreed to the change in supervisory arrangements.\nFor UKRI funded PGRs, this information should also be shared with the Graduate School in order that they can notify relevant Research Councils and funders.  There may also be a requirement to inform a candidate’s sponsor, in the case of PGRs supported by other routes.\n6. Eligibility to act as supervisor\nSubject to the following sections, any member of staff currently undertaking research in the relevant discipline may be nominated to supervise a PGR, provided that they intend to remain in post for the normal duration of the candidate’s registered period of study and irrespective of whether they are on an open or fixed-term contract.\nSenior Research Fellows (Level 5) who have experience of successful supervision may act as the lead supervisor.\nPostdoctoral research staff may act as second supervisors in a co-supervision arrangement.\nHonorary Professors, Honorary Lecturers, recently retired staff and Emeritus Professors may act as second supervisors in a co-supervision arrangement.\nPostdoctoral staff and Level 4 Research Officers (or equivalent) who do not meet these criteria may act as an assistant supervisor within a supervisory team working with a lead and second supervisor.\nAt UNM all supervisors of postgraduate research degree programmes are required to undergo structured supervisor training.\n7. Academic staff supervising for the first time\nIncludes:\nlead supervisor; attending the course for postgraduate certificate in higher education; assigning a mentor; role of Head of School\nStaff who are appointed as supervisors for the first time are not normally permitted initially to act as the lead supervisor, but should first be required to gain supervisory experience by acting in a co-supervision arrangement with an experienced member of staff. Exceptionally, Heads of Schools may apply to the University for permission to allow a new member of academic staff to act as the main supervisor, if a good case can be made that the member of staff's experience makes it appropriate for them to act in this capacity.\nStaff appointed as supervisors or assistant supervisors for the first time, must undertake relevant training and development in supervisory practice (such as that offered by the Researcher Academy, Doctoral Training Centres and Partnerships). They must be in a co-supervision arrangement with a member of staff who has relevant supervisory experience and can and is willing to act as a mentor with respect to doctoral supervision.\nFor more information on supervisory training and development opportunities, please consult the following:\nResearcher Academy Supervisory Sharepoint\n8. Non-University staff\nIncludes:\nresponsibility of Head of School\nStaff of outside institutions who are not members of the academic or research staff of the University of Nottingham may, in appropriate circumstances, be appointed to act as co-supervisors as part of a supervisory team e.g. industrial supervisors on an Industrial Cooperative Awards in Science & Technology (CASE) award, supervisors for PGRs registered under the regulations governing students registered in outside organisations (see below). In such cases the candidate must still have 2 University of Nottingham supervisors. This rule can be waived in cases where the PGR is a member of a Doctoral Training Programme (DTP) or Doctoral Training Centre (DTC) and the other supervisor is appointed through that DTP/DTC.\nHeads of Schools should consider the proposed external supervisor's expertise in the candidate’s research topic and their research standing and ensure that they are made aware of and enabled to fulfil the University's expectations of supervisors and are offered opportunities to engage in development activities.\n9. Staff without Doctorates\nIncludes:\nacademic staff at lecturer grade; permission\nAcademic staff at Lecturer grade who do not hold a doctorate themselves should not normally be permitted to act as the lead supervisor of a PGR.\nHowever, a Head of School may apply to the University for permission to allow such a member of academic staff to act as the lead supervisor if a good case can be made that the individual's research and professional background makes it appropriate for them to act in this capacity.\n10. Maximum number of PGRs\nIncludes:\nresponsibilities\nThe Head of School has responsibility for determining the number of PGRs an individual member of staff may supervise.\nNo maximum number is recommended but this should depend on the ability of the individual supervisor to deliver quality supervision as detailed in this Quality Manual under The Roles and Responsibilities of a Supervisor.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nResponsibilities of the supervisor\nAdditional information\nIncludes:\nMPhil/Doctoral supervision arrangements form; research supervisors - SharePoint\nMPhil/PhD supervision arrangements form\nResearch supervisors - SharePoint\nStudents studying in outside organisations\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nGraduate School - PGR\nGS-PGR@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n21 June 2024||"

        "content": "Change of supervisor - The University of NottinghamChange of supervisor\nThis page sets out the procedure for changing supervisor, including the temporary absence of a supervisor, problems with a supervisor, and withdrawals. Its content is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.1. Policy\nIncludes:\nallocation of supervisory team; requesting a change to supervision arrangements\nFrom the academic session 2007/08, new students will be allocated a supervisory team containing at least two supervisors. Schools have the option to appoint joint or lead supervisors within the supervisory team. These regulations apply to any member of that supervisory team.\nIf a supervisor is unable to continue with the supervision, the postgraduate student is entitled to have a new supervisor who is suitable for the task assigned promptly to them on either a temporary or permanent basis to ensure that they are not subject to undue periods of unsupervised study.\nStudents and supervisors will also have the opportunity to request a change to the supervision arrangements in the event of insuperable difficulties arising from that relationship.\n2. Responsibility of the Head of School\nIncludes:\ncontinuous supervision throughout period of registered study; student funded on a studentship\nThe Head of School is responsible for ensuring that students are provided with continuous supervision from the beginning of and throughout their period of registered study. Therefore, if a supervisor is unable to continue supervising a student or if the supervisory relationship breaks down, the Head of School must take all reasonable steps to find a replacement supervisor with the appropriate expertise and supervisory experience who is acceptable to the student (and, if appropriate, to the student's sponsor).\nWhere a student is funded on a studentship awarded to a particular supervisor or on a specific research grant, it may not always be possible to change the supervisor. When there is a change to the arrangements for a student's supervision, the Head of School should inform Student Services or equivalent.\n3. Short-term and temporary absence of a supervisor\nIn the case of the short term and temporary absence of a supervisor (for example, through illness) the Head of School must nominate a temporary supervisor who has the qualifications and qualities to meet the immediate needs of the student. \"Short-term\" supervisory arrangements should not normally exceed 3 months.\nIf a longer term but still temporary absence is anticipated the Head of School should discuss with the student (and if appropriate) the original supervisor, the relative benefits of operating extended temporary supervision arrangements up to but not exceeding 6 months, or allocating a new permanent supervisor.\n4. Supervisor leaves\nIf a supervisor permanently ceases supervision (for example, through moving to a post at another institution), then the Head of School should discuss with the student the options which are available and which benefit the student.\nOne option will be to allocate a new permanent supervisor and the Head of School should make all reasonable efforts to identify another member of staff at Nottingham with the appropriate academic background and supervisory experience. However, it may not always be possible or in the student's best interests to allocate a new supervisor.\nOther options which then might be considered are to ask the supervisor who has moved to another institution to continue to supervise at a distance and to appoint a second local supervisor at Nottingham, or to seek to facilitate the student's transfer to the supervisor's new institution.\n5. Problems with supervisor\nResearch students who find themselves without supervision or who are unhappy with their supervision for any other reason should discuss the matter with their supervisor and/or joint/lead supervisor in the first instance, or (if this is inappropriate) with the School Postgraduate Student Adviser or the Head of School, or member of staff with delegated authority at UNM or UNNC and should ask that appropriate action be taken to resolve the difficulty.\nThese discussions must be undertaken in confidence and without fear of recrimination with the aim of resolving the difficulty amicably.\n6. Postgraduate Student Adviser for the School\nIncludes:\nmediating between student and supervisor; responsibilities\nHeads of Schools should designate a full-time member of academic staff to act as an independent School Postgraduate Student Adviser (SPSA) to advise research students about general procedures and, in particular, to deal confidentially with any concern raised by a postgraduate student about their studies and supervision. If the supervisory relationship has broken down, the SPSA should be available to advise and support the student.\nIf appropriate, the SPSA should also offer to mediate between the student and the supervisor and, subject to confidentiality, should be prepared to advise the Head of School on a possible solution.\nFor more information about the responsibilities of the SPSA, please consult the following:\nResponsibilities of the Postgraduate Student Advisor\n7. Supervisor brings research students to Nottingham\nWhere it would be beneficial for a new member of staff to bring with them to Nottingham the research students who were under their supervision at the previous institution, Heads of Schools should be sympathetic to such requests and, where appropriate, seek to facilitate the transfer.\n8. Withdrawal\nOn rare occasions, it may not be possible to make replacement supervision arrangements, and as a consequence the student may have to withdraw from their course.\nForms\nIncludes:\nsupervision arrangements form\nSupervision arrangements form\nSupervision arrangements form\nSupervision arrangements form\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nGraduate School - PGR\nGS-PGR@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n21 June 2024||"

This information may be of interest to staff and students from across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.Thesis restriction - Policy\nIncludes:\nscope; external funding considerations; thesis restriction application form\nIf a thesis includes work which is politically, commercially or industrially sensitive, it is possible for a student to apply for access to the electronic copy held in Nottingham eTheses (for UK and Malaysia) or Research Information System (RIS) for China, to be restricted. In such case an application for restriction should be included when the student submits their thesis.\nSome research projects are funded, partly or wholly, by outside agencies and a restriction may be stipulated in the contract which is drawn up with the University. If no contract exists, it is the responsibility of the student to put together a structured case to support their application for a restriction, in consultation with their supervisor.\nThe University's Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) can grant a restriction of access to a thesis for a period not exceeding 2 years in the first instance with the possibility of an extension of that period up to a maximum of 5 years.\nThesis restriction means that no part of the thesis, including the bibliographic details (author, title and abstract), is discoverable. Students should be aware that imposing a restriction means they will be unable to show their thesis is published within the repository.\nRestrictions will normally only be granted on the basis of the actual or potential confidentiality of the contents of the thesis, e.g. to protect a patent application.\nA restriction on a thesis does not affect the award of the degree in any way.\nAn application form is available here:\nApplication for restriction on PGR thesis\nApplication for restriction on PGR thesis\nApplication for restriction on PGR thesis\nAs part of the application the student's supervisor is responsible for providing a statement regarding the research being undertaken, including comments on the need for a restriction and the current research project number.\nThesis restriction - Procedure\nIncludes:\napplication; submission; decision; extension; retrospective application\nThe student concerned completes an 'Application for a Restriction to be placed on a Thesis' form (provided in the previous section) ensuring all boxes have been completed. Although the student may not know the relevant research project number, it is important that the student's supervisor provides this piece of information.\nThe form is then submitted by the student, with their thesis, to Registry and Academic Affairs in the UK or the Graduate School in UNNC or the Student Registry Office in UNM, for processing.\nOnce the Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) has made a decision about whether or not the restriction can be granted, the student will receive formal notification of the decision from the University. A copy of this notification is sent to the student’s supervisor and UoN Libraries to implement the restriction in Nottingham eTheses or RIS as required.\nA final decision on an application can be expected within approximately 6 weeks of receipt of the form by Registry and Academic Affairs in the UK or the Graduate School in UNNC or the Student Registry Office in UNM.\nIt is possible to apply for an extension to the period of restriction once the initial period has lapsed and this is done by completing another copy of the original form. The onus is on the student to do this, as there is no process for notification of the expiry of the restriction.\nIn the case of a retrospective application, the electronic copy may already be discoverable. In this case the form may be copied by the student or School to UoN Libraries to request immediate restriction as a temporary measure until the Committee reaches a decision.\nThesis embargo\nRequesting an embargo will defer publication of the thesis for a set period of time, usually a maximum of 1-2 years, before it becomes available to read. (For Creative Writing students only, an extended embargo of up to 7 years to enable publication of the work is permissible).\nEmbargos are not formal restrictions as they can be directly requested by the thesis author at the point of upload to the Nottingham eTheses or RIS repository, as relevant.\nBefore choosing to request an embargo, students should discuss the matter with their supervisor to ensure they take account of funder/sponsor expectations relating to open access for the thesis, as well as any other funding conditions.\nIt is important to note that with embargoed theses, the bibliographic details (author, title and abstract) remain discoverable and available to read. A student should consider whether the abstract contains commercial or sensitive information in consultation with their supervisor when they are assessing whether embargo or a formal restriction is required.\nWhere an embargo is applied to the thesis it cannot be released without author permission. Please consider pre-approving a request from supervisors to view the thesis during an embargo period.\nMore information on how to request embargo can be found here:\nSubmission information pack for PGRs\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nGraduate School - PGR\nGS-PGR@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n31 May 2024||"

Its content is primarily aimed at prospective students but may also be of interest to staff based at the UK campus.Overview and responsibilities\nIncludes:\nlocation of criteria; School responsibilities\nThe setting of entry criteria is the responsibility of the school to which the course is attached, within the overall policy requirements agreed by the University. Minimum entry criteria are published online in the Programme Specification document for each course, following approval from Quality and Standards Committee (QSC).\nThe Admissions Office maintains a database of minimum entry requirements for all taught courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level, which includes both academic and non-academic criteria. The database is updated following consultation with school admissions staff prior to the start of each academic session. This information is then used in generic University publications, such as programme specification documents, online and hard copy University prospectuses, and UCAS publications.\nSchool responsibilities\nIt is the school’s responsibility to ensure that published entry requirements (both academic and non-academic) are fair, transparent and accurate wherever they are published\nSchools must ensure that these criteria are applied consistently and fairly when making decisions\nSchools may not introduce additional requirements or tests part-way through an applications cycle\nAdmissions requirements\nIncludes:\ncriteria; undergraduate; postgraduate taught; Recognition of Other Learning; research degrees\nUndergraduate\nThe University minimum for entry is normally grades BBC at A-level or equivalent (BCC for foundation programmes) although most courses require higher grades for entry. Schools can insist on a particular level of performance in a subject at GCSE, A Level or other examinations, including English language qualifications. Where particular subjects will not be considered, these should be specified (for example, General Studies).\nWhen assessing an application for undergraduate study, admissions selectors will normally consider the following information on the UCAS form:\nAcademic ability and potential as shown by GCSE and AS level results and predicted or actual A level grades or equivalent\nMotivation to study a particular discipline\nRelated work or voluntary experience showing commitment to a chosen career (particularly important for courses with a vocational element)\nExtra-curricular activities, achievements and interests\nPostgraduate taught\nWhen assessing an application for taught postgraduate study, admissions selectors should ensure that applicants hold a good first degree with at least second class honours, or an equivalent qualification. Evidence of relevant personal, professional and educational experience may also be taken into account.\nWhere a school wishes to admit an applicant on the basis of significant relevant work experience in lieu of an appropriate academic qualification, it will need to make a case for exceptional entry to be considered on behalf of Quality and Standards Committee (QSC).\nMore information on admissions requirements can be found here:\nRecognition of Other Learning\nResearch degrees\nIn considering applications for admission to a research degree, a school will consider if the applicant would be able to achieve the standards required for the award of that degree.\nNormally, applicants will be required to possess a first degree with at least Class 2 Division I Honours, or an equivalent qualification for PhD or other doctoral degree, or at least Second Class Honours for entry onto an MPhil or other research master's degree (for example, MRes, or MA or MSc by Research) programme.\nAdditional links\nMake an enquiry\nAdmissions Office\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK\nAdmission queries UNUK\nUNNC\nAdmission queries UNNC\nUNM\nAdmissions queries UNM\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n12 April 2022||"

For more information, please consult the following:\nRegulations for the Degree of Master of Research (MRes) before September 2020\nStudents from countries that are not familiar with the MRes qualification may, alternatively, be awarded a MA or MSc by Research in order not to disadvantage those students. The regulations for these awards will, though, be exactly the same as for the MRes. This will also be permitted, with QSC approval, where required by professional, regulatory or accrediting bodies.\nApprenticeship Programmes\nAn individual undertaking an apprenticeship programme at the University of Nottingham (UK campus) will be considered as a part time student. All regulations in the Quality Manual that make reference to ‘students’, also apply to apprentices, unless otherwise stated.\nAdmissions requirement\n1.\nRequirements for admission to a research degree are set out in the Academic entry requirements page, which can be found here:\nAcademic entry requirements\nProgramme of study\n2.\nStudents will be admitted to a one year, full-time (two years, part-time) programme of study unless it is an apprenticeship, where it will be stated in the programme specification.\nTaught and thesis elements\n3.\nStudents are required to study modules worth 180 credits, of which between 20 and 60 credits (or equivalent) should normally be obtained from taught modules at Level 4 or from other units offering generic training within the University (such as the Researcher Academy) or from within any other relevant courses run within Schools. The remaining credits will then be obtained from the thesis  at Level 4. Any taught modules and research training taken must be clearly relevant with the student’s research topic.\n4.\nStudents will receive regular supervision while undertaking the thesis component, specific to their learning needs and thesis topic. This will be as set out in the thesis description and in line with the requirements for supervision contained in the regulations for research degrees.\nFor more information regarding minimum number of supervisions, please consult the following:\nResponsibilities of the supervisor\nTransfer to PhD\n5.\nA candidate shall not be permitted to count the same period of research for both the degree of Master of Research (MRes) and the degree of PhD. However a candidate for the MRes degree may, after a period of not less than nine months study for the MRes and prior to the submission of the thesis, with the approval of the supervisor and Head of School (or equivalent), submit a transfer form to the University for permission to be registered as a candidate for the degree of PhD instead of a Master of Research. The period of registration for the degree of PhD should normally be three years (and not less than two years) full-time from the initial date of registration for the MRes.\nAssessment\nIncludes:\nmodule specifications; submitting thesis before end of registered study; viva voce examinations\n6.\nIn regard to the thesis, the maximum word length of the thesis is dependent on the credit size of the thesis and the following apply:\n120 credits – 25,000\n140 credits – 30,000\n160 credits – 35,000\nThe maximum word limit is inclusive of appendices, footnotes, tables but not the bibliography. The Thesis should embody the result of the candidate’s advanced study and research.\n7.\nStudents are required to submit their thesis prior to the end of the period of registered study. An electronic version saved as a searchable PDF, should be submitted to the relevant Registry and Academic Affairs PGR team or equivalent (in a form prescribed by the University), who will forward the thesis to the Examiners. The thesis should not, whether in the same or a different form, have been submitted to this or any other University for the award of any degree.\n8.\nThe thesis must be the result of the student’s own work. The requirement does not preclude a student obtaining limited assistance with proof-reading and with the routine collection and/or processing of data under guidelines and instructions clearly devised by the student. When such help is obtained it should be with the prior approval of the supervisor who must be satisfied that the spirit of the 'own work' requirement is not breached.\n9.\nThe thesis is examined by both an External Examiner and an Internal Examiner appointed under the regulations governing the assessment of research degrees, who should provide independent reports on the thesis, indicating whether the thesis module has been passed; and also whether a viva voce examination is necessary. Where a viva voce examination is required by the examiners, this should be conducted in line with the relevant regulations for MPhil degrees.\nFor more information about the Viva voce examinations, please consult the following:\nViva voce examinations\nOutcomes of examination\nIncludes:\naward of degree; where a student obtains a fail mark or failed thesis or training credits; nottingham etheses service\n10.\nThe degree is awarded where all taught modules and training credits and the thesis module have been passed. The pass mark for all taught modules is 50%, but marks of 40%-49% can normally be compensated in up to 20 credits if the overall average for the taught modules taken is 50% or over. Training credits will be assessed on a pass/fail basis.\n11.\nWhere a student obtains a fail mark in a taught module that is not compensated, or fails the thesis module or training credits, the student has one further opportunity to pass those modules. All reassessments must be completed within one year of the end of the student's period of registered study.\n12.\nThe qualification awarded to the student will include the subject of study undertaken as notified to the student at the time of admission.\n13.\nSuccessful candidates will be eligible to graduate once their thesis has been uploaded to the University’s eTheses service and approved by the Internal Examiner or, in cases where there are two external examiners, the lead External Examiner. For more information, please consult the following:\nNottingham eTheses\nUNNC RIS\n14.\nFor apprenticeship programmes:\nOn integrated apprenticeship programmes the End-Point Assessment serves as a final credit bearing module for the degree. It also constitutes the summative assessment for the apprenticeship award. Each specific End-Point Assessment plan outlines the final classification criteria for the apprenticeship award.\nOn non-integrated apprenticeship programmes, the End-Point Assessment is undertaken after completion of the degree, and is taken as a standalone assessment external to the University.\nA course may only have progression requirements more stringent than those stated in regulation 10 above if there is a demonstrable requirement from a professional accrediting external body or is required to meet Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) requirements for attainment on an apprenticeship programme.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nGraduate School - PGR\nGS-PGR@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n23 October 2024||"

All applications from candidates who have disclosed a disability will be considered in the same way as any other application and a decision will be made that is based upon the candidate’s academic merit and potential.\nThe legislation with which the University's policy complies is now the Equality Act 2010 (replacing the previous provisions that were outlined in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001) which applies equally to disabled students and disabled applicants.\nApplicants are encouraged to disclose a disability when they apply by completing the relevant section of their application form (Personal Details of the UCAS form, section 10 of the Postgraduate Application paper form, section 4 of the online Postgraduate application form).\nUCAS code descriptors\nThe codes on the UCAS form for Disability/Special needs (including dyslexia) and medical condition box are as follows:\nTable of UCAS Disability/Special needs and medical condition codes and descriptors\nCode\nDescriptor\nA\nNo disability\nB\nYou have a social/communication impairment such as Asperger's syndrome/other autistic spectrum disorder\nC\nYou are blind or have a serious visual impairment uncorrected by glasses\nD\nYou are deaf or have a serious hearing impairment\nE\nYou have a long standing illness or health condition such as cancer, HIV, diabetes, chronic heart disease, or epilepsy\nF\nYou have a mental health condition, such as depression, schizophrenia or anxiety disorder\nG\nYou have a specific learning difficulty such as dyslexia, dyspraxia or AD(H)D\nH\nYou have physical impairment or mobility issues, such as difficulty using your arms or using a wheelchair or crutches\nI\nYou have a disability, impairment or medical condition that is not listed above\nJ\nYou have two more more impairments and/or disabling medical conditions\nA code other than A means the applicant has indicated some form of disability (for the purposes of this function, dyslexia is included as a disability) and reasonable adjustments may be required.\nNext steps\nWhere an application made indicates a disability code other than A or G this application is referred by the Admissions Office to the Disability Support Team. The applicant’s requirements are considered and appropriate action is taken to ensure the applicant understands the support available. In some cases, a meeting will be organised with the applicant and the School to explore such requirements and how these may be met.\nFollowing this meeting, support services will be put in place and reasonable adjustments made at the University to address barriers which disabled students may encounter in the learning, teaching and assessment environment and which may affect performance.\nThe Admissions Office will send a letter to all other applicants who have disclosed a disability and who Disability Support do not consider it necessary to meet. The letter is sent to those who have accepted conditional, unconditional and insurance offers, outlining services available at the University. A form is enclosed with the letter inviting the applicant to contact Academic or Disability Support with any requirements they may have.\nExceptional reasons for the rejection of an application\nWhilst the provisions of the Equality Act 2010 normally make it illegal to reject an applicant on the grounds of disability, there are three instances in which a university can reject a disabled applicant if they have the entry criteria necessary and these are:\nOverriding health and safety concerns;\nBarriers resulting from professional requirements;\nNecessary reasonable adjustments cannot be made.\nOpen day or interview arrangements\nIncludes:\nDisability Liaison Officer; contacts and correspondence\nEach School has a Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) to provide a point of reference, advice and guidance for members of staff and students in the School about disability issues and support. Admissions staff should check with applicants whether they have any individual requirements prior to the interview or Open Day, and may wish to seek guidance from the School’s DLO beforehand.\nIn certain situations, a Department or School will carry out its own admissions selection process (for example, research degrees).\nFor more information about the DLO role, please consult the following:\nStudent with disabilities\nContacts and correspondence\nTo ensure that student performance at assessment is optimised and to comply with our legal obligations, any correspondence inviting potential students to an interview or assessment should always include the following text: \"Please inform me as soon as possible if you have any individual requirements which need to be made for you because of a disability in order to attend the interview, for example a ground floor interview room\".\nAcademic or Disability Support may also be contacted before the visit if the candidate has any academic-related study requirements or issues relating to accommodation or transport prior to the student’s visit.\nUpon offer of a place to study at the University, the applicant should be referred to the Disability Support Team.\nFor more information about the University's Disability Support Services, please consult the following:\nDisability Support Services\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK\nAdmission queries UNUK\nUNNC\nAdmission queries UNNC\nUNM\nAdmissions queries UNM\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n21 June 2024||"

Its content is primarily aimed at prospective students based within the UK but may also be of interest to staff and current students at all of the University's campuses.Overview\nIncludes:\nUCAS and University requirements; DBS clearance; accommodation\nThe UCAS application and the University direct application requires applicants applying to regulated courses to declare any relevant criminal convictions.\nRegulated courses are those which require a DBS clearance to enable a student to complete the course.\nThe University does not require applicants to other courses to declare criminal convictions. However, it is required if applicants wish to stay in University owned or managed accommodation.\nDeclaration of criminal convictions for 'Regulated Courses'\nIncludes:\npoint of consideration; process of admission; advanced checks and permission\nAny declaration of a criminal conviction will not form part of the initial academic assessment of the application. Should the Admissions tutor wish to make an offer of a place to an applicant who has declared a relevant criminal conviction for a regulated course, this will need to be considered prior to issuing the offer.\nIn the event of an academic offer being agreed, the application will then be passed to the Head of Admissions (UCAS/UTT) or Head of Admissions (Direct). The Head of Admissions will contact the applicant to request further details of the offence, including, if applicable, references from probation officers.\nThis information will then be sent to the course director (for the course applied for) and the Campus Life Director to consider whether the applicant is able to comply with regulatory requirements and to decide the applicants suitability to study on the regulated programme or to practice in the regulated profession. This may involve carrying out an enhanced DBS check prior to offer and consulting partner organisations (such as the NHS) - however, this will only be done with the applicant's permission.\nFair chance for students with convictions\nWe believe everyone with the potential and ambition to go to university should have the opportunity to do so, regardless of background. People with criminal convictions face obstacles and barriers to accessing university, yet higher education has the power to transform their lives by helping them move forward and make a positive contribution to society.\nThe University of Nottingham pledges to give applicants with a criminal record a fair chance.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nUnlock: a fair chance for students with convictions\nApplicants with criminal convictions applying to stay in University owned or managed accommodation\nIncludes:\nrequirements;\nspent convictions; accommodation decisions (when unspent conviction is declared); Data Protection Policy\nThe University will ask all applicants who make an application to stay in University owned or managed accommodation to declare any unspent criminal convictions. We will use this information to ensure we adequately assess any risk posed to others staying in University owned or managed accommodation.\nSpent convictions\nA criminal conviction can become 'spent' after a period of time. The length of time it takes to become spent is defined by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 and depends on the sentence or disposal made by the court following the conviction. Until that period has passed, the conviction is considered 'unspent' and should be declared. Please note the following:\nFurther convictions can impact when other convictions become spent.\nSentences of over four years in prison cannot become spent.\nMost cautions, reprimands and final warnings become spent immediately, so will not normally be 'unspent'.\nFor more information, please consult the following:\nRehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974\nAccommodation decisions (when an unspent conviction is declared)\nIf an applicant wishing to stay in accommodation declares an unspent criminal conviction the application will be passed to the Head of Accommodation Services who will contact the applicant to request further details of the offence, including, if applicable, references from probation officers. This information will then be sent to the Director of Student Experience who will carry out a risk assessment to confirm if by staying in university accommodation the applicant poses a risk to other students or staff.\nThe Director of Student Experience may make one of the following decisions:\nThe applicant can stay in university accommodation without any further conditions\nThe applicant can stay in university accommodation subject to further conditions\nThe applicant cannot stay in university accommodation\nThe University will only use information relating to criminal convictions where the law allows us to do so in line with our Data Protection Policy. Personal data relating to criminal convictions will be retained confidentially and securely and access to that data will be strictly controlled.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK\nAdmission queries UNUK\nUNNC\nAdmission queries UNNC\nUNM\nAdmissions queries UNM\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n27 January 2025||"

Details about the standards of behaviour expected and associated policies can be found on the University’s website. For more information, please consult the following:\nStudent Community\nStudent Conduct\nThe University is committed to ensuring that any interaction with an applicant\n1\nis conducted in a professional, courteous and respectful manner and it expects that any communication from an applicant is conducted in the same way.\n1\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “applicant” in the context of this policy refers to both those who are currently in the process of applying to the University and offer holders. In terms of this policy, a person remains an “applicant” until the point of registration.\nApplicants should note that the University may take action in response to inappropriate behaviour or language, both generally and specifically towards its employees or members of the wider University community (including other applicants). Hostile, aggressive or otherwise inappropriate behaviour or language, whether expressed verbally or in writing, and excessive levels of contact, will be viewed seriously and may adversely affect the consideration of an application, appeal or complaint.\nWhere the University becomes aware of inappropriate language or behaviour by applicants, it will act to address this. The University will normally warn an applicant that his or her behaviour or language is inappropriate and that action is being considered, but where the behaviour or language is particularly inappropriate no warning need be given before action is taken. Such action may include the withdrawal of an offer or the rejection of an application. Conduct which constitutes a criminal offence may be referred to the relevant authorities.\nProcess\nIncludes:\nbasis; potential actions; further investigation; role of Director of Student and Campus Life\nWhere inappropriate behaviour or language is identified as requiring action it will be brought to the attention of the Director of Student and Campus Life. At that time, the applicant will be contacted by Admissions and asked to provide an explanation for the identified inappropriate problematic behaviour. On the basis of the evidence collated the Director of Student and Campus Life will take one of three actions:\n1.\nMake a judgment on the basis of the available evidence and take one of the outlined actions within this process\n2.\nInitiate an investigation to ensure that sufficient evidence is available to make an appropriate judgment\n3.\nDismiss the concern\nWhere it is felt that further investigation is required, the Director of Student and Campus Life will commission this investigation from the Investigation and Conduct department within Campus Life. Whilst staff from Admissions and other departments may be used to assist with the collation of evidence, the Investigation and Conduct department must lead any investigation to ensure the independence of the investigation.\nWhere the Director of Student and Campus Life believes they have sufficient evidence to make a judgment, they will choose one of the following actions:\n1)\nDismiss the concern\n2)\nProvide the applicant with a formal written warning\n3)\nReject any/all applications made\n4)\nWithdraw any offer that has been made to the applicant.\nTo assist with their decision making, the Campus Life Director can take guidance and advice from colleagues on any case.\nAppeal\nIncludes:\nprocess; consideration; potential outcomes\nAn applicant may appeal an outcome of this process but must do so within seven days of receipt of written confirmation of the outcome. Appeals cannot be a rehearing of the original case and can only be brought on the following grounds:\nWhere there is fresh evidence not initially considered that might reasonably have resulted in a different decision\nWhere there was a procedural irregularity\nWhere the decision taken by the Director of Student and Campus Life is manifestly unreasonable\nAppeals will be heard by the Deputy Registrar. Where the Deputy Registrar had involvement in the original case, the appeal will be heard by the Registrar. Upon considering the appeal, the Deputy Registrar may:\n1.\nAllow the appeal and either:\na.\nReduce the outcome\nb.\nDismiss the original concern\n2.\nDismiss the appeal\nThe decision of the Deputy Registrar is final.\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK\nAdmission queries UNUK\nUNNC\nAdmission queries UNNC\nUNM\nAdmissions queries UNM\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n25 June 2024||"

Its content is primarily directed at staff across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses but may also be of interest to students and prospective students.1.0 Purpose\nThis page provides more information about making changes to programme and module specifications.\n2.0 Key principles\nSchools are expected to submit all curriculum changes, specifically changes to programme and module specifications, to Registry and Academic Affairs (RAA) in the UK or local academic services unit (ASU) at UNNC or Student Registry office at UNM by the published deadlines.\nThe reasons for this are:\nCurriculum information in Campus Solutions is published to internal and external audiences via the Online Curriculum Catalogue and in the Online Prospectus\nStudents use information in the Online Curriculum Catalogue to inform module selection for the next academic year\nProspective students may use information in the Online Prospectus to help them decide whether to apply to study at the University of Nottingham\nWe are required to provide students with accurate material information about their programme of study in good time to ensure adherence with Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) guidelines\nAll curriculum change must be obtain the necessary relevant School and/or faculty level approvals prior to its formal submission to RAA/ASU/SRO.\nInformation about curriculum sits within the programme and module specifications and is also used to inform the Online Prospectus.\nThere are set deadlines during the academic year when curriculum information can be updated. The deadlines are different in the UK depending on whether the changes relate to items that are considered ‘material’ or not.\nMore information about the Annual Review of Curriculum is provided here:\nAnnual review of curriculum\n2.1 Programme specification changes requiring consultation or notification\nWhen making changes to programme specifications, in some circumstances (see below) it is necessary to communicate and/or consult with particular student groups.\nWhere changes to programmes of study fit into one of the categories below, Schools/ must consult with all current students that will be directly affected by the planned changes at the first opportunity, and students must be given the chance to comment on the changes.\nChanges to progression requirements which make progression more difficult.\nChanges to award or classification procedures which may make it more difficult for a student to receive an award or a higher class of award.\nA change to the administration of a programme by a different school.\nAny changes to material information of a programme (except changes to material items which are solely for the benefit of students).  Material information includes (but is not limited to) core modules, programme title, location of study, duration of study, external accreditation, award type, assessment at programme level and delivery of teaching at programme level. Please see Appendix 1 of the\nUniversity of Nottingham’s Consumer Protection Policy\nwhich provides a full list of information which is considered “material”.\nMaterial changes which are for the benefit of students (i.e. changes that enhance their learning experience) must be communicated to them but consultation is not required. Schools are responsible for communicating such changes to their students.\nWhere students object to the planned change(s), the School will need to seek approval from QSC for the proposal (if it still wishes to go ahead).\nIn the case of changes to undergraduate award or classification procedures (such as a change to degree class weightings), the changes must not apply to any existing Part I, II, or III students without their explicit written consent.\n2.2 Module changes requiring consultation/notification\nWhen making changes to module specifications, in some circumstances (see below) it is necessary to communicate and/or consult with particular student groups.\nSchools must communicate with students affected by any planned curriculum changes to core modules fitting into the categories below at the first opportunity and they must be given the opportunity to comment on the changes:\nChanges to the learning outcomes of the module\nChanges to the manner in which the module is assessed\nA change to the assessment regulations which makes it more difficult for a student to pass the module\nAny changes to material information of a module (except changes which are solely for the benefit of students).  Material information includes (but is not limited to) core modules and location of study. Please see Appendix 1 of the\nUniversity of Nottingham’s Consumer Protection Policy\nwhich provides a full list of information which is considered “material”.\nMaterial changes which are for the benefit of students must be communicated but consultation is not required. Schools are responsible for communicating such changes to their students.\nThe credit amount or level of a module may not be altered; such changes require the creation of a new module.\nIf any of the above changes are to optional modules which occur prior to the start of the session in which the amended optional module will be delivered, but after returning students have selected that module, then these changes must be communicated to students at the earliest opportunity and they must be given the opportunity to comment.\n2.3 Changes to programmes requiring QSC approval\nApproval on behalf of Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) is required for the following changes to programme specifications:\nChanges which are contrary to the guidelines for programme specifications, the University's Qualifications Framework, or any other University policy or regulation\nSignificant changes to the programme structure (section C.2 of the programme specification). It is the school’s responsibility when changing section C.2 to ensure that no changes to the learning outcomes are required\nChanges to section C.2 which affect another School and where the other School has objected to the change. Please note, a school changing section C.2 of any of its programmes has a responsibility to consult another School directly affected by that change\nAny changes to curricula to which the majority of  students are opposed\n2.4 Changes to modules requiring QSC approval\nApproval on behalf of Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) is required for changes to module specification information which are contrary to the module specifications guidelines, or any other University policy or regulation; or to which any students currently enrolled on the module are opposed.\n2.5 Method of communication with students\nSchools must ensure that all relevant students have been consulted on planned changes as described above, including those who are on a break in their learning.\nWhilst planned changes can be communicated and discussed at the Staff Student Forum (SSF), Schools must ensure that all students are sent the information personally and have a mechanism for students to provide any feedback (e.g. via email). Evidence of consultation must be provided to Registry and Academic Affairs (UK), Academic Services Unit (UNNC) or Student Registry Office (UNM)along with the change(s).\nIf there are any majority objections to the planned change(s), the School will need to seek approval for the proposal (if it still wishes to go ahead) from QSC before proceeding.\n3.0 Related regulations, policies and procedures\nMore information about deadlines for curriculum change is provided here:\nCurriculum review for programme and module specifications\nMore information about updating curriculum information is provided here\nCurriculum review for programme and module specifications\nFor more information about how to complete a programme specification\nProgramme specification guidance\nNew/revised curriculum maps are required with all programme specification changes.  A template for a curriculum map can be found here:\nCurriculum map\nFor more information about how to complete a module specification\nModule specification guidance\nFor more information about curriculum and timelines updating see:\nCurriculum Approvals and Advisory Team (CAAT) SharePoint (internal UK only)\nSignificant changes to the programme structure may also require the programme to be re-approved.

        "content": "Closing or suspending a programme - The University of NottinghamClosing or suspending a programme\nThis page sets out the University's procedures for closing or suspending a programme of study. While it is primarily intended for staff across the UK, China and Malaysia campuses, it may be of interest to students.1.0 Purpose\nThis page outlines the procedures for closing or suspending a programme of study at the University. It aims to protect the interests of students, applicants and the University by detailing the necessary steps and considerations for such actions.\n2.0 Key principles\nA School cannot independently close or suspend a programme due to the contractual obligations between students, applicants, and the University.  Decisions to close or suspend a programme may be driven by several factors, including, but not limited to:\nThe programme is not financially viable\nLow enrolment (averaging ten of fewer students over three years) (UK only - see also administrative closures below)\nStrategic changes in the school/faculty teaching portfolio\nUnavailability of teaching staff that cannot be replaced\nRecommendations from Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Bodies (PSRBs)\nStrategic decisions at the University level\n2.1 Timing\nDecisions to close or suspend a programme of study must be taken in good time, and wherever possible, before programmes are advertised to students (around 18-21 months before the closure or suspension is to take effect). However, strategic or other reasons may necessitate shorter notice periods.\nThis is to ensure the University meets it obligations in relation to Consumer Protection Law (CPL) and Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) guidance.  In the UK, programmes of study are advertised to prospective students in the Online UG or PGT Course Prospectus (see publication dates below).\nUK Publishing dates for UG and PGT Course Prospectus\nUndergraduate Prospectus\nPublication c. 1 March in the calendar year before students commence the course (for example, March 2024 for 25/26 entry)\nPostgraduate Taught Prospectus\nPublication c. 1 July in the calendar year before students commence the course (for example, July 2024 for 25/26 entry)\n3.0 Roles and responsibilities\nSchools and Faculty staff are responsible to seek local approval to close or suspend a programme in accordance with local procedures, including consulting with partner Schools and current students as applicable.  Then it is necessary to follow the procedure below to request the closure/suspension.\nWhen a request to close or suspend a programme is submitted the RAA curriculum team will gather data on prospective and current students and make a recommendation to the relevant Faculty.  If there are no applicants or impacted students, the Associate Director (Curriculum and Timetabling) or the Senior Manager (Head of Curriculum) can approve requests to close or suspend programmes (otherwise the cases go to QSC for approval).  After approval, RAA will liaise with the relevant departments.\nIf a programme closure or suspension affects prospective students, then all communications with applicants must be undertaken by External Relations and Admissions or equivalent.\n4.0 Procedural steps\n4.1 School and Faculty endorsement\nSchool and Faculty endorsement is required to close or suspend a programme. All closures and suspensions, including administrative closures, will require endorsement at School and Faculty level before making the formal request.\nEndorsement for the closure or suspension of a programme must be sought at School level first (e.g. from Education and Student Experience Committee, Head of School, UNNC school meeting), followed by endorsement from the Faculty (in the UK this would be from the FPVC or FAPVC, UNNC Faculty Executive Board and UNM Campus Teaching and Learning Committee).\nThere may be local variations for seeking endorsement, depending on School, Faculty or campus structures in UNM/UNNC; however, at the end of this stage there must be clear evidence of support from both the School and the Faculty to close or suspend the programme. Endorsement can be recorded via email or noted in committee minutes; evidence of endorsement must be retained for audit purposes.\n4.2 Consultation with other Schools/Campuses, as necessary\nFor joint, major/minor, and interdisciplinary courses, agreement from the partner School(s) is required before submitting a formal closure or suspension request. Programmes offered on multiple campuses should have consensus across all campuses prior to submitting the formal request to close or suspend the programme.\nAt the University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) and the University of Nottingham Ningbo Campus (UNNC), the view of the relevant campus committee must be sought prior to the submission of a formal recommendation, so that the impact of the decision on the University as a whole can be taken into consideration.\nIf there are any HR implications in relation to the closure or suspension of a programme, Schools must contact the relevant Faculty HR Business Partner for advice.\n4.3 Consultation with current students\nIf the recommendation to close or suspend the programme only affects new entrants (and not current students), then all current students must be allowed to complete their studies, for example, including any students on leave of absence/break in studies or who have a deferred place. A comprehensive teach out plan must be provided with the request.\nWhere the recommendation is to close or suspend the programme and current students will be affected in some way, the views of current students (including those on leave of absence/break in studies) on the proposed arrangements must be sought by the School before submitting the request.\nThe consultation must encompass the following:\nConfirmation that the standard of provision to current students will be maintained throughout their period of study and\nConfirmation that the previously stated learning outcomes of the programme of study will still be achievable by current students, even if the range of module choices is smaller because of staffing reductions or\nOptions for current students regarding transferring to another programme of study within the University or to another institution\nSchools have autonomy over how they invite students to share their views; however, Schools must ensure all affected students are directly contacted and invited to express their views if they wish. Receiving views from students might include one of more or the following methods:\nEmail\nStudent Staff Fora discussion\nRunning an in-person seminar/ drop-in session\nRunning a Teams session\nMoodle discussion\nThe School will be expected to provide, and retain for audit purposes, evidence that all affected students have been contacted on the proposed formal notification to close or suspend a programme of study, including detail about any objections raised by students in the consultation. Discussion at Student Staff Fora alone will not be sufficient to confirm direct contact with all students. Records of the consultation(s) must be retained by the School.\n4.4 Complete the programme closure/suspension form\nOnce Schools have appropriate School and Faculty endorsement and have consulted with programme partners and students as required (see above), the School must complete the form to formally request the programme closure or suspension.\nRequest to close or suspend a programme of study - MS form\nThe form requires the School to provide information in support of the recommendation, including:\nThe reason for the closure or suspension\nConfirmation of the number of applications and/or offer holders\nIdentification of all stakeholders affected by the closure/suspension and anticipated impact on them, for example, Schools, Campuses, Contractual Partners, Recruiting Agents, Employers and any proposed arrangements/mitigations (if applicable)\nImpact on, or changes to, our contractual obligations with existing students. This includes part time students or any students who are on a leave of absence/break in learning. If there is an impact, include details of any consultation that has taken place with students and objections raised. If there is no impact on current students, the ‘teach out’ strategy must be made clear\nThe proposed arrangements for applicants and offer holders (if applicable)\n4.5 Administrative closure\nClosing a programme with no current students, applicants or offer holders is referred to as an administrative closure.\nFor UNUK programmes with no current students, applicants or offer holders may be closed outside of the aforementioned UK closure/suspension time restrictions, with appropriate School and Faculty approval.\n4.6 Consultation with the wider University\nFor programmes with either current students, applicants or offer holders, the following must also be undertaken:\nUpon receiving the closure/suspension form, RAA will consult with the wider university to ensure the implications and consequences for prospective and current students, including those on leave of absence from their studies/break in studies, have been considered and mitigated.\nThe departments to be consulted include:\nFaculty Marketing and Finance Teams\nStudent Recruitment Team Current students (if applicable) Partners, and/or relevant teams in RAA responsible for partnership activity (if partnership)\nProfessional and Work Based Learning Team (if apprenticeship)\nProfessional/statutory/regulatory bodies (if applicable)\nHead of Strategic Partners (if TUNIC offer holders are affected)\nRelevant teams in RAA regarding the status of students on leave of absence/break in studies\nConcerns raised during this consultation will be communicated back to the School for comment.\n4.7 Approval process\nRecommendations for closure or suspension of programmes where there are no applicants or offer holders, and/or where the School demonstrates that there is no impact on current students, including those on leave of absence/break in studies, or other stakeholders, will be approved by the Associate Director (Curriculum and Timetabling) or the Senior Manager (Head of Curriculum) on behalf of the Quality and Standards Committee (QSC).\nAll other cases will be submitted to QSC for consideration. Legal advice may also be sought in certain cases.\nThe recommendation to close or suspend the programme will only be accepted if the rationale is sufficiently strong enough to justify any legal or reputational risk or disruption to applicants, offer holders, students and/or other stakeholders. The requirements in the previous sections must also be satisfied.\n4.8 Next steps after approval\nWhen a recommendation for suspension or closure is approved, RAA will inform the following departments:\nThe departments to be informed include:\nFaculty Marketing Team (to consider marketing implications of closure or suspension)\nFaculty Finance Team (to consider financial implications of closure or suspension)\nStudent Recruitment Team (to consider recruitment implications of closure or suspension, and confirm the current number of applications/offers)\nCurrent students (if applicable, see above)\nPartners, and/or relevant teams in RAA responsible for partnership activity (if partnership)\nProfessional and Work Based Learning Team (if apprenticeship)\nProfessional/statutory/regulatory bodies (if applicable)\nHead of Strategic Partners (if TUNIC offer holders are affected)\nRelevant teams in Registry and Academic Affairs (RAA) regarding the status of students on leave of absence/break in studies\nOnce a closure or suspension recommendation has been accepted, the School must ensure that all necessary amendments are made to School publications and websites, and RAA to all University publications and websites.\nAfter approval is obtained for the suspension or closure, then RAA will notify UCAS, if applicable, by informing the University's UCAS correspondent.\n4.9 Communication with prospective students\nIf a programme closure or suspension affects prospective students, then all communications with applicants must be undertaken by External Relations and Admissions or equivalent.\nApplicants must not be contacted until a closure or suspension request has been approved; however, Admissions may, at the request of the School and in consultation with RAA, suspend applications until a decision has been made. Schools need to consider and agree options for offer holders (including those that have accepted offers) before they are informed.\nIf you would like any further information about the programme of study closure or suspension process, please email:\nss-curriculumadvice@nottingham.ac.uk\n5.0 Version control table\nVersion control table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nChanges to clarify the process to request closure or suspension of a programme.  Also reformatted to align with new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework\nQSC\nAugust 2024\nIf you would like any further information about the programme closure or suspension process, please email:\nss-curriculumadvice@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n20 September 2024||"

Its content is primarily directed at staff on all campuses but may also be of interest to students and prospective students.1.0 Purpose\nThis page contains instructions for the approval of new programmes by change, to be offered by the University on all campuses. This includes approval for changes to micro-credential programmes offered by UoNO.\n‘New programmes by change’ are defined as curriculum change requests to existing programmes where the proposed curriculum change is either a significant change at one time point or incremental changes over time which would lead to (or have led to), effectively, a new programme.\nThe purpose of the approval process is to ensure that appropriate academic standards are set and maintained, and that programmes offered to students make available learning opportunities which enable the intended learning outcomes to be achieved.\n2.0 Key principles\nIn order to meet the responsibility for academic standards and quality of learning opportunities, please consult the UK Quality code for HE advice and guidance, QAA Characteristics statements and QAA Subject benchmark statements (see links below). The University regulations on minimum expectations relating to teaching and learning must also be consulted.\n2.1 Free speech\nWhen developing a new programme, appropriate regard must be given to the importance of promoting free speech.\nPlease consult the following for further information about the Freedom of Speech Act:\nFree Speech and Academic Freedom at the University of Nottingham\nOffice for Students guidance on free speech.\n2.2 Academic freedom\nIn relation to programme and module development, approval, and delivery, it should be noted that academics would not be prohibited from developing or delivering a programme or module on the ground that it involves giving serious consideration to ‘controversial or unpopular opinions’. This is not a reason that the programme would be approved, rather it is not a reason it could be declined. For instance, there will remain business or logistical reasons to not grant approval to a programme or module.\n2.3 Guidance about what constitutes a new programme by change\nThere are opportunities to make changes to existing programmes of study without the need for reapproval of the whole programme (see the ’Annual Review of Curriculum’ Quality Manual page for more details (link below). However, significant changes to the curriculum constituting a new programme by change, as described above, will require approval of the programme of study as a new programme; referred to as 'new programme by change'.\nTo help Schools understand whether proposed changes to existing programmes of study will require approval as a new programme, the following guidance has been developed.\nNew programme approval scenarios and requirements\nScenario\nNew programme approval required\nChanges to programme learning outcomes\nThis may be considered a new programme by change for approval purposes if the changes to programme learning outcomes significantly alter the skills and knowledge that a student will have acquired and what students will be able to do upon successful completion of their studies.\nChanges to programme structure\nThis may be considered a new programme by change for approval purposes if:\nThere are significant revisions to a programme’s core modules either in one year or across the whole programme. For example, if more than half of core modules are changing.  However this does depend on the mix of core and optional modules. Revisions to core modules might include:\nAdding/removing modules\nMoving modules within the programme structure\nReplacing old modules with new ones\nReplacing old modules with new ones of a different credit value\nIncreasing/decreasing the core/optional credit split\nThere are significant revisions to optionality. This will be particularly important for programmes which have a higher ratio of optional to core modules, or those that use restricted or alternative groups of modules\nNot all proposed programme changes may fit neatly into one of the above scenarios because they may include changes to multiple elements which change the programme significantly from what was originally approved.\nFor further advice and guidance about whether the changes you are considering would be a new programme by change, please contact:\nss-curriculumadvice@nottingham.ac.uk\n2.4  Timeline for approval and CMA considerations (UNUK Only)\nTo meet the university’s UKs publishing deadlines for the undergraduate and postgraduate prospectus, and to achieve a full cycle of marketing, Schools must aim for their programme to be developed and approved at least 5 weeks ahead of the publishing deadlines in the table below.\nUK Prospectus Publishing deadlines for UG and PGT programmes\nUndergraduate\n1 March in the calendar year before students commence the course (e.g. 1 March 2024 for 25/26 entry)\nPostgraduate Taught\n1 July in the calendar year before students commence the course (e.g. 1 July 2024 for 25/26 entry)\nThere may be occasions when Schools request the introduction of a new programme by change after the release of the online prospectus. Each request will be carefully considered by RAA, Marketing, Admissions, the Legal team and other key individuals in the University as appropriate. For new programmes by change the main consideration would be risks relating to Consumer and Markets Authority (CMA) guidance, and specifically changing curriculum information which is material to prospective student decisions. In these circumstances the\nLate Change approval process\nwill be followed.\n2.5 Latest dates for programme approval (all campuses)\nSeparate to the prospectus deadlines above, the latest possible dates for programme approval are detailed in the table below. Changes this late should be exceptional requests only. Colleagues are expected to  build in time contingences to their development timelines to allow for possible delays, for example if the Programme Review Panel ask for major revisions to be submitted to the next panel or if the stakeholder consultation surfaces issues which need time to be resolved. It is recommended that colleagues aim for one or two panels earlier than the latest possible dates to ensure programmes are approved in time for planned start dates.\nLatest dates for obtaining university approval for new programmes\nRequire UCAS recruitment\nRequire timetabling\nLatest date for university approval\nYes\nYes\n31 July in the calendar year before students commence the course\nNo\nYes\n31 January in the same calendar year students commence the course\nNo\nNo\n31 July in the same calendar year students commence the course\nFor further advice and guidance about timelines for submission and approval, please email:\nss-curriculumadvice@nottingham.ac.uk\n3.0 Roles and responsibilities\nIt is not necessary to get School and Faculty endorsement for a new programme by change. It will be necessary to show that the School has approved the curriculum changes with their School education and student experience committees or equivalent  in the usual manner.  A full and/or addendum business case is not needed either.\nThe School are responsible to complete the new programme by change outline form. This includes liaison with stakeholders e.g. affected Schools, employers, students and external advice as appropriate.\nRAA colleagues will review the new programme by change outline form and liaise with necessary University colleagues.\nSchools planning significant changes to their programmes are expected to consult with Registry and Academic Affairs (RAA), Student Registry Office (SRO) or Academic Services Unit (AMU) (for UNUK, UNM and UNNC respectively), to discuss their plans and be appropriately advised which route to follow (i.e. curriculum change or new programme by change). Schools that submit significant changes through the curriculum review cycle which need to instead follow the new programme by change process will be contacted, advised accordingly and asked to resubmit by this route.\n4.0 Procedural steps\nThe new programme by change process is a condensed version of the new programme approval process; not requiring external advice or a full or addendum business case.\nThe new programme by change process set out below needs to be read in conjunction with the new programme by change process flow charts, which can be accessed here:\nNew programme by change flow chart (UNUK)\nNew programme by change flow chart (UNM)\nNew programme by change flow chart (UNNC)\nPlease note, colleagues in UNM and UNNC complete each of the required steps for new programme by change but vary the order of completion due to local campus structures. These are reflected in the flow charts.\n4.1   Completion of new programme by change outline form\nSchools must confirm their intentions to make significant changes to their programme by submitting brief details on the new programme by change outline form. This is to ensure that relevant university colleagues are aware of developments.\nThe new programme by change form can be found here:\nNew programmes by change outline Form\n4.2   Development of curriculum documentation\nThe next step in the process is for the School to prepare the curriculum documentation, i.e. the programme specification, the module specification and the curriculum map, plus any partnership agreements (if required).\nUpon receipt of the new programme by change outline Form, RAA will assign a Business Partner to work with the School to assist in the development of their curriculum documentation.\nThe partnering process will ensure Schools receive appropriate and useful advice about University regulations and operability of programmes in any systems. RAA will seek advice from relevant professional services colleagues on any areas which might need specialist input. For new programmes by change, the Marketing Team will be consulted to ensure compliance with Consumer and Markets Authority (CMA) guidance (UK only).\nIf the new programme also requires a partnership agreement, Schools must submit curriculum documentation with the partnership agreement to the Partnership Operational Development Meeting (POD) so they can be considered together.\nFor more information about partnership approval process please consult the following:\nPartnership and Placements\nThe Business Partner from RAA will confirm with the School when all curriculum documentation are  complete and meet the required standard in terms of university regulations and operability in any systems. The application will then proceed to the next stage.\n4.3   Consultation on curriculum documentation\nRAA will make available the curriculum documentation (programme specification, module specifications, curriculum map, and partnership agreement if applicable) to a wide range of internal stakeholders across the University, including Schools, Faculties and Professional Services Departments, for a two-week period for scrutiny. This is the final opportunity for stakeholder queries to be raised.\nDuring this process the stakeholders may send comments/queries for the School to address.\nThe School must respond to the comments/queries raised by stakeholders during this consultation process in a timely manner and address them to the stakeholder’s satisfaction. Otherwise this may lead to delays in approval.\nAny unresolved issues raised during the consultation period will be referred to a Programme Review Panel for consideration and approval (see below).\n4.4   New programme by change approval – no outstanding issues\nProgrammes of study which have no unresolved issues from the consultation with stakeholders, and do not present any challenging operational or regulatory issues, will be approved by Senior Manager (Head of Curriculum) or an Associate Director in Registry and Academic Affairs on behalf of Quality and Standards Committee (QSC).\n4.5 New programme by change approval - at a Programme Review Panel\nAll other programme by change requests will be put forward for consideration at the next available Programme Review Panel for approval. Representatives from the School must attend the Programme Review Panel to respond to questions.\nPanel dates are published prior to the start of the academic year, with around six meetings scheduled in each academic year. The ‘next available date’ will take into consideration time for the Programme Review Panel to consider the documentation in advance. As a general guide, papers for the previous step need to be submitted to RAA at least one month prior to the Programme Review Panel to allow time to complete the two-week Stakeholder Consultation and for the Programme Review Panel to consider the documentation in advance.\nThe Programme Review Panel at a minimum will consist of two QSC members, one of which will take the role of Chair, and senior representation from RAA: normally the Senior Manager (Head of Curriculum) or delegate. The academic lead(s) for the programme of study being considered will be expected to attend the panel and answer any queries put to them. Other colleagues may be invited to attend the panel if they have noted issues on the business case or during the consultation that are yet to be resolved.\nIn considering the curriculum documentation, the Programme Review Panel will:\nMake a judgement on any issues that fall outside the current scope of the Quality Manual.\nReview the operability of the proposed new programme, considering stakeholder feedback in relation to this.\nConsider the key academic aspects of programme specification – that is, the learning outcomes and how they will be taught and assessed. This consideration will be largely limited to ensuring that the learning outcomes are appropriate to the level of qualification being awarded.\nEnsure that there has been adequate consultation with other affected Schools, and that any comments or objections from these other Schools have been appropriately addressed.\nEnsure that the overall programme has coherence in terms of logic in structure, intellectual integrity and assessment methods being aligned with programme content, learning outcomes and learning and teaching activities.\nThe Panel can either:\nApprove (either outright or with minor changes which can be returned for final approval by Chair’s Action within an agreed timeframe)\nAsk for major revisions to be submitted to a future panel\nReject the proposal\nThe decision of the Programme Review Panel will be communicated by RAA to the School and other university stakeholders.\n4.6 Regulatory approval for new programmes by change (UNM/UNNC only)\nProgrammes in UNM and UNNC will require a further approval from local authorities before a programme is launched. In UNM approval is required from the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA) and the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE). In UNNC approval is required from the Ministry of Education (MOE). The SRO and ASU  in UNM and UNNC respectively will help support this process.\n4.7 After the programme is approved\nAfter approval is obtained for the new programme by change (see previous steps), the programme will be created in the student records system, UCAS codes created (if applicable) and opened for marketing/recruitment. Programme and module specifications will be published online in the Online Course Catalogue, which then becomes the definitive record.\nStudents may not be registered on a programme until the programme has been fully approved.\n5.0 Related regulations, policies and procedures\nFor further advice and guidance on any aspect of new programme by change approval, please email:\nss-curriculumadvice@nottingham.ac.uk\nFor more information about the UoN Qualifications Framework, please see:\nUniversity of Nottingham Qualifications Framework (section 7)\nFor more information about making changes to programmes of study via the annual curriculum review cycle, please consult the following:\nChanges to programme specifications\nClosing or suspending a programme\nProgrammes\nSee the ’Annual Review of Curriculum’ Quality Manual page for more details about how to make changes to existing programmes of study without the need for reapproval of the whole programme:\nAnnual updating of curriculum\nFor more information about the UK Quality Code for HE Advice and Guidance and QAA guidance, please see:\nUK Quality Code for Higher Education Advice and Guidance – Course Design and Development\nQAA Characteristic Statements\nQAA Subject Benchmark Statements\nFor more information about the University's minimum expectations relating to teaching and learning, please consult the following:\nMinimum expectations for levels of teaching and learning activity\nFor more information about relevant contacts in RAA relating to curriculum, please consult the following page:\nCurriculum Approvals and Advisory Team (internal SharePoint)\nFor more information about partnership approval process please consult the following:\nPartnership and placements\nFor more information concerning programme specifications, please consult the following:\nProgramme specification guidance\nFor more information concerning module specifications, please consult the following:\nModule specification guidance\nFor Programme Review panel dates, please consult the following:\nProgramme Review Panel dates (internal SharePoint)\n6.0 Version control table\nVersion control table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nReformatted to align with the new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework\nQSC\nAugust 2024\nFor further advice and guidance on any aspect of programme approval, please email:\nss-curriculumadvice@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n05 February 2025||"

While it is primarily intended for staff across the UK, China and Malaysia campuses, it may also be of interest to students.1.0 Purpose\nThis page sets out the regulations about how to request a new module, which will help staff who are designing new modules as well as those who are updating existing modules.\n2.0 Key principles\n2.1  Conditions for a new UK-based module approval submission\nIn submitting a new UK-based module for approval, one of the following conditions must apply:\nThat the school indicates the existing module which is being withdrawn and replaced by the new module (intended to be on a module to module basis);\nThe module forms an integral part of a new programme\nThe new module is a credit bearing continuing professional development (CPD) module and does not sit in a programme\nThat the new module runs concurrently with an existing module and there will be no additional associated timetabling or\nThat the new module is a dissertation or project or individual reading module with no additional resource requirements (that is, timetabling, assessment or facilities)\nThat the new module has been created to protect student mobility (i.e. creating a semester length version of a year long module)\n2.2 Free speech\nWhen developing a new module, appropriate regard must be given to the importance of promoting free speech.\nPlease consult the following for further information about the Freedom of Speech Act:\nFree Speech and Academic Freedom at the University of Nottingham\nOffice for Students guidance on free speech.\n2.3 Academic freedom\nIn relation to programme and module development, approval, and delivery, it should be noted that academics would not be prohibited from developing or delivering a programme or module on the ground that it involves giving serious consideration to ‘controversial or unpopular opinions’. This is not a reason that the programme would be approved, rather it is not a reason it could be declined. For instance, there will remain business or logistical reasons to not grant approval to a programme or module.\n3.0 Roles and responsibilities\nSchools are responsible for completing the relevant new module templates, consulting with the relevant parties, and to get the necessary School level approvals and send the paperwork to RAA.\nRAA are responsible for reviewing the document in a timely manner.\nNew Modules that meet the above conditions and the regulations outlined in the module specification guidance can be approved on behalf of Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) by RAA. Any new module requests that do not meet the above conditions and/or do not conform with the module specification guidelines would need QSC approval. In such circumstances, the school will need to make an exceptional case to Quality and Standards Committee (QSC) for the module to be approved, citing the significant institutional interests served by the module.\n4.0 Procedural steps - How to request a new module\nSchools in UNUK, UNM and UNNC intending to introduce a new module must:\ncomplete the New Module Specification Template (provided in Section 5 below)\nseek School level approval for the new module\nsubmit the New Module Information Template to Registry and Academic Affairs (RAA),  Student Registry Office (SRO) or Academic Services Unit (ASU) (for UNUK, UNM and UNNC respectively).\nSchools must consult with any other Schools that they are aware of that are likely to have a legitimate interest in the creation of the module, e.g., if the subject matter of the new module has any overlap with existing provision in another School.\n5.0 Related regulations, policies and procedures\nThe module specification template for a new module is provided here:\nNew module information template\nFor more information about completing a new module specification template, please consult the following:\nModule specification guidance\nFor more information about the curriculum review cycle, please consult the following:\nCurriculum review of programme and module specifications\nModule information in Campus Solutions is used for relevant central processes and will be published in the Online Course Catalogue.\nOnline course catalogue\nVersion control table\nVersion control table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nClarifications made as part of a review of this section of the quality manual.  Also reformatted to align with new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework\nQSC\nAugust 2024\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please email:\nss-curriculumadvice@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n05 February 2025||"

Its content is applicable to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses.These regulations apply only to Distance Learning programmes - programmes that are explicitly described as such in the relevant programme specification.\n1.0 Purpose\nThis policy covers educational provision leading to an award or part of an award that is delivered and/or supported and/or assessed through means which generally do not require the student to attend particular classes or events at particular times and particular locations. This includes practices such as e-learning, distance learning, blended learning, flexible learning, instructor-led training and the use of web-based materials to supplement classroom-based learning.\nThe policy outlines the minimum requirements which are expected by the University to be met by Schools when delivering this provision. The requirements of this policy are in addition to the normal expectations on schools which are detailed throughout the Quality Manual.\n2.0 Key Principles\n2.1 Learning Support\nProspective students should receive a clear and realistic explanation of the expectations placed upon them for study of the programme or elements of study, and for the nature and extent of autonomous, collaborative and supported aspects of learning.\nStudents must have access to:\nA schedule for any learner support available to them through timetabled activities, for example tutorial sessions or web-based conferences;\nClear and up-to-date information about the learning support available to them locally and remotely for their programme or elements of study;\nDocuments that set out their own responsibilities as learners, and the commitments of the University and school for the support of a programme or element of study.\nStudents must have:\nFrom the outset of their study, an identified contact, either local or remote through e-mail, telephone, fax or post, who can give them constructive feedback on academic performance and authoritative guidance on their academic progression;\nWhere appropriate, regular opportunities for inter-learner discussions about the programme, both to facilitate collaborative learning and to provide a basis for facilitating their participation in the quality assurance of the programme;\nAppropriate opportunities to give formal feedback on their experience of the programme.\n2.2 Assessment of students\nStudents must have access to:\nInformation on the ways in which their achievements will be judged, and the relative weighting of units, modules or elements of the programme in respect of assessment overall;\nTimely formative assessment on their academic performance to provide a basis for individual constructive feedback and guidance, and to illustrate the awarding institution's expectations for summative assessment.\n2.3 Virtual Learning Environment delivery system\n2.3.1 Delivery\nAny programme or element offered for study must have had the reliability of its delivery system tested, and have contingency plans that would come into operation in the event of the failure of the designed modes of delivery;\nThe delivery system of the programme or element of study delivered through e-learning methods must be fit for its purpose, and have an appropriate availability and life expectancy;\nThe delivery of any study materials direct to students remotely through, for example, e-learning methods or correspondence, must be secure and reliable, and there must be a means of confirming its safe receipt.\n2.3.2 Assessment of students\nStudents' work must be properly attributed to them, particularly in cases where the assessment is conducted through remote methods that might be vulnerable to interception or other interference;\nAny mechanisms, such as web-based methods or correspondence, for the transfer of their work directly to assessors, must be secure and reliable, and there must be a means of proving or confirming the safe receipt of their work.\n3.0 Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Roles and Responsibilities\n3.1 Delivery\nSchools must ensure that students have access to:\nInformation that sets out the respective responsibilities of the school and University for the delivery of the programme, module, or element of study;\nModule descriptors, to show the intended learning outcomes and teaching, learning and assessment methods of the module(s);\nA clear schedule for the delivery of their study materials and for assessment of their work.\nSchools must also ensure that students can be confident that:\nStudy materials, whether delivered through staff of a programme presenter or through web-based or other distribution channels, meet the expectations of the University in respect of the quality of teaching and learning-support material for a programme or element of study leading to one of its awards;\nThe provision is subject to Annual Monitoring and the University Periodic Review process.\nFor more information about the University's review processes, please consult the Programme Monitoring and Review documents linked below\n3.2 Learning support\nSchools must ensure that students can be confident that:\nStaff who provide learning support on these programmes have appropriate skills, and receive appropriate training and development;\nLearning support, whether delivered through staff of a support provider or through web-based or other distribution channels, meets the expectations of the University for the quality of learning support for a programme of study leading to one of its awards.\n3.3 Virtual Learning Environment delivery system\nThe Learning Technologies section of University of Nottingham Libraries has responsibility for meeting the requirements below for the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) systems which they maintain, namely Moodle. However, if schools use delivery systems which are not supported by Information Services (IS) then they would be expected to assume responsibility for ensuring that the following requirements are met.\n4.0 Related Regulations, Policies and Procedures\nProgramme Monitoring and Review\n5.0 Version Control Table\nVersion Control Table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nReformatted to align with the new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework, based on content last modified on 17th October 2023\nQSC\nJuly 2024\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n16 January 2025||"

Schools, departments and divisions should facilitate this by providing a mechanism for students to email or contact in some other way their fellow students.\nPlease note that training and development activities for student representatives are managed by the Students’ Union.\nThe relevant representatives of the teaching staff must attend every meeting and all course representatives should receive an invitation; Senior Tutors should be members of LCFs. Where appropriate, consideration should be given to inviting relevant representatives from Information Services (IS), Student Services and the Learning Technologies section of University of Nottingham Libraries.\nThe school, department or division should display the names and contact details of the representatives on the LCF, minutes of LCF meetings, external examiner reports and school responses to those reports on an appropriate forum that is clear and readily available to students (such as Moodle).\nAgendas, minutes and action points\nThere should be a simple mechanism for both staff and students to have items placed on the agenda for discussion.\nAll meetings must be minuted, clearly indicating agreed action points and who is responsible for carrying them out.\nEach agenda must include a report on any previously agreed action points.\nStudents are encouraged to undertake such duties as preparing agendas, chairing meetings, and minuting them.\nLCF minutes must be taken into consideration in the school's annual monitoring processes.\nIt is not expected that every action requested by student representatives will be implemented, but it is expected that they should be given proper consideration and the grounds for non-implementation should be explained.\nOnline community\nIncludes\n: Learning Community Forum - Moodle\nThe online Learning Community Forum (hosted on Moodle) is here to support the collaboration of staff and students in discussing teaching and learning matters.

These regulations can be accessed via:\nUniversity of Lincoln - Mitigating Circumstances\nAnnex C - Fitness to practise\nThe Fitness to Practise regulations of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at the University of Nottingham shall apply to this programme, subject to the following adjustments:\nThe term ‘trainee’ shall be used throughout in preference to that of ‘student’.\nConcerns that a trainee may not be fit to practise Clinical Psychology shall be made to the Programme Co-Director at the trainee’s degree-awarding university.\nReferences to ‘the head of studies’ shall be read as referring to the relevant Programme Co-Director.\nIn the section headed ‘Investigations’, the reference to “the University’s Occupational Health Service” shall be read as referring to the trainee’s employer’s Occupational Health Service.\nThese regulations can be accessed via:\nRegistration, attendance and study\nThe current form of the regulations, as they apply to the programme are as follows: Fitness to Practise Procedure\n1.   Initiation of the Procedure\n1.1.\nAny concerns that a trainee may have acted in such a way or may suffer from a health problem which may render that trainee a person not fit to be admitted to and practise Clinical Psychology should be disclosed to the Programme Co- Director at the trainee’s degree awarding university.\n1.2.\nThe disclosure should normally be made in writing using the concern form. In cases where the initial disclosure is not in the concern form format e.g. notification of criminal conviction, then the relevant Co-director should ensure that a concern form containing the disclosure is completed. The person making the disclosure must identify themselves; disclosures which are raised anonymously will not normally be considered. In exceptional circumstances the discloser’s identity may be permitted to remain confidential.\n1.3.\nThe raising of a concern form does not usually indicate a fitness to practise issue. However, the existence of multiple concern forms may show a pattern which does indicate a fitness to practise issue. Therefore on the receipt of an individual concern form which on its own does not raise a fitness to practise issue the Co- directors, should jointly review whether other concern forms have been raised, which when all considered together raise issues regarding the trainee’s fitness to practise, e.g. professional behaviour.\n1.4.\nWhere there are concerns that are serious then a trainee may be excluded from clinical placements by their Clinical Tutor on advice of the Co-directors. Some examples of a serious concern would include, but not as an exclusive list, situations where:\npatients may be placed at risk or;\nthe profession might be brought into disrepute by the public knowing that the trainee remained in a clinical environment or;\nthat a trainee’s conduct was deemed to be disruptive to the delivery of clinical care or clinical teaching  in a partner, usually NHS, organisation.\nConcerns may be such that trainees can be suspended from their course with immediate effect by the Dean or by the head of studies. If this decision is based on a concern related to discipline or health and safety then appropriate procedures as set out within the Code of Discipline for Students and the Quality Manual should be followed.\nIf trainees are allowed to return from suspension, they will be expected to comply with any conditions decided by the School or imposed as part of the outcome of any other procedure.\n1.5.\nA trainee will not be allowed to graduate from either University if they are subject to a fitness to practise investigation or hearing which has not been completed.\n2.\nInvestigations\n2.1.\nOn receipt of a disclosure which gives rise to a fitness to practise concern, the relevant Co-director shall promptly, and normally within 5 working days, arrange for the matter to be investigated and shall notify the trainee of the following:\nThe basis of the concerns and any allegations against them.\nThe identity of the investigating\nofficer.\nAny limitations or conditions placed upon the continuance of studies or supervised practice during the period of the\ninvestigation.\n2.2\nThe trainee can register an objection to the appointment of the investigating officer on the basis of a lack of impartiality. Such an objection needs to the relevant Co-director within 5 working days. Examples would include where the investigating officer has initially raised the concern e.g. probity issues, or where the investigating officer has had interaction with the trainee on an unrelated contentious issue. If this objection is upheld a new investigating officer should be appointed.\n2.3\nThe investigating officer may request members of staff connected with the\ncase to provide written comments on the trainee’s conduct and/or health, explaining why there is concern as to fitness to practise. Factual information about the trainee’s professional progress on the course and any other relevant documentation should also be\nprovided.\n2.4.\nThe investigating officer shall interview relevant individuals including the trainee themselves. At such interviews the investigating officer shall be accompanied by an assistant who shall prepare a written note of the\ninterview\n2.5.\nThe investigating officer should ensure that the trainee is advised of appropriate pastoral support mechanisms within their University and Trainees’\nUnion.\n2.6.\nThe trainee is entitled to have a person of their choosing attend the interview with them in order to support them at the meeting. The trainee should\nconfirm the name and status of the person accompanying them in writing to the Investigating Officer in advance of the interview. The person supporting the trainee is not attending the interview as an advocate or character witness.\n2.7.\nThe trainee may be required to attend their employer’s Occupational Health Service in order that advice on his or her fitness to practise on medical grounds may be sought. In cases where there is evidence of recurring health problems or with addictive behaviours, Occupational health referral is\nrequired.\n2.8.\nSave in exceptional circumstances, the investigating officer shall, no later than 15 working days after the referral by the Co-directors, make a written report of the results of the investigation to the Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at The University of Nottingham detailing all evidence obtained. From this point onwards all further stages of the Fitness to Practise Procedure are handled by the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at The University of Nottingham.\n3.  Referral to Fitness to Practise  Committee\n3.1\nPromptly on receipt of the report from the investigating officer, and in any event within 5 working days, the Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences shall consult the Dean of the Faculty who will determine, in the light of the seriousness of the matter and the strength of the evidence, whether the case should be referred to the Fitness to Practise\nCommittee.\n3.2\nThe Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences will notify the trainee in writing of the\nfollowing.\nThe outcome of the investigation and the Dean’s decision.\nWhether the matter is to be referred to the Fitness to Practise Committee together with full details of the procedures to be  adopted.\nThe imposition of any conditions/limitations placed on the trainee’s\nstudies.\n3.3\nIn the event that the Fitness to Practise Committee is to be convened, the Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences will notify the trainee\nof the identity of the Committee members and the date of the proposed meeting of the Committee and make available to him/her, all of the evidence detailed in the investigating officer’s\nreport.\n3.4\nThe trainee shall be allowed at least 15 working days in which to prepare his/her case. All information on which the trainee intends to rely must be received by the FTP Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, who will then distribute this information to the members of the Fitness to Practise Committee and the Investigating Officer, at least 5 working days before the date set for the meeting of the\nCommittee.\n3.5\nIn exceptional circumstances the Dean may determine that a warning should be issued to the trainee without a Fitness to Practise Committee hearing as the means of disposal of the FTP procedure, according to section 7 (below). The usual example of when this would be considered is when a criminal conviction or caution has been admitted. This disposal shall only be considered when the following four conditions are\nmet:\nWith the agreement of the trainee, confirmed in writing to the FTP Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine & Health\nScience\nWhen the trainee fully admits to the allegation upon which a concern has been based. This admission would be part of the evidence provided by the investigating officer\nThe trainee demonstrates insight into the nature of the concern and expresses remorse as specified in the evidence provided by the investigating officer\nWhen the Dean is satisfied that the nature of the concern does not raise the possibility\nof\nanother\noutcome\nbeyond\na\nwarning\nas\nspecified\nin\nsection\n7\n(below)\n4.   Attendance at the\nMeeting\n4.1\nThe trainee will be required to attend the meeting in person.If the trainee fails to attend without reasonable explanation, the Committee will consider the case in the trainee’s absence. The Chair will have discretion as to what constitutes a ‘reasonable\nexplanation’.\n4.2\nThe University’s case will be presented by the investigating officer or his or her nominee.\n4.3\nAt the discretion of the Chair, the Committee may also call upon other persons (whether or not a current member of the University) to provide advice on specific aspects of the case in writing or in\nperson.\n4.4\nThe trainee is entitled to have a person of their choosing attend the hearing with them (referred to here as \"the friend\"), and is permitted to have the person of their choosing speak on their behalf. The trainee should confirm the name and status of the person accompanying them in writing to the Secretary no less than four working days before the\nhearing.\n5.  Composition of the\nCommittee\n5.1\nThe Committee will comprise as a minimum the Chair (a senior member of the academic staff from outside the professional discipline of the trainee)\nand\ntwo members. At least one member should be a clinically active member of the\nsame professional discipline as the trainee. The Committee will be serviced by a Secretary who is not a member but will be present throughout the\nproceedings.\n5.2\nAnyone who is asked to be a member of the Committee, who has been personally involved in the trainee's case at any prior stage needs to inform the Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of this. This person will then not be able to be a member of the Committee and another member will need to be appointed.\n6.   Procedure for the conduct of the meeting\nThis section is a guide to the conduct of the meeting itself. The Chair has discretion to vary these arrangements as they think fit.\n6.1\nPrior to the meeting the Secretary to the Committee will ensure the trainee has copies of all documents circulated to members of the Committee and is aware of the procedures to be\nfollowed.\n6.2\nThe Chair will ask if any member has been personally involved in the trainee's case at any prior stage and, if so, will ask them to withdraw from the\nmeeting.\n6.3\nThe\ntrainee,\nthe\nfriend\n(if\nattending)\nand\nstaff\nwill\nthen\njoin\nthe\nCommittee.\n6.4\nThe Chair will introduce by name and explain the functions of the members of the Committee, the staff, and any others     present.\n6.5\nThe Chair will explain the powers of the Committee, as set out in\nsection7.\n6.6\nThe Chair will invite the investigating officer (or nominee) to make an opening statement and then invite the Committee to ask questions. Other staff attending will be offered the same opportunity to make a statement and may be asked questions.\n6.7\nThe Chair will invite the trainee or the friend to make a statement. The Chair will explain that the Committee will wish to hear directly from the trainee in their own words.\n6.8\nMembers of the Committee will be invited to question the\ntrainee.\n6.9\nThe Chair will invite any other person(s) called upon by the Chair to attend the meeting (as referred to in section 4.3), to make a brief statement,\nand\nwill then invite the Committee to ask\nquestions.\n6.10\nAt each stage the Chair has discretion to allow reciprocal questioning by the various\nparties.\n6.11\nOnce the Chair is satisfied that the Committee has completed their questioning and the trainee and staff have had a full opportunity to convey information to the Committee, both the trainee and members of staff will\nwithdraw.\n6.12\nThe Committee will then discuss the\ncase.\n6.13\nIf for any reason the Committee requires further clarification of any aspect of the case from either the trainee or staff members they must be all invited back into the meeting while the questioning takes place. When the Chair so determines they will then leave the meeting\nagain.\n6.14\nThe Committee will make its decision on the basis of the balance of probabilities and shall be taken by a simple majority of the members present and voting. The Chair shall have a casting vote in the event of a\ntie.\n6.15\nThe decision, and any findings of fact, will be conveyed to the trainee and the other parties as soon as possible, and will in any event be conveyed to the trainee in writing within two working days of the decision being\nreached.\n7.  Powers of the Fitness to Practise\nCommittee\n7.1\nThe\nCommittee,\nfollowing\nconsideration\nof\nthe\ncase,\nhas\nthe\npower\nto:\na.\npermit the trainee to continue with the course with no warning or sanction;\nb\n.\nwarn the trainee that there is evidence of misconduct but the trainee’s fitness to practise is not impaired to a point requiring any of the sanctions listed\nbelow;\nc.\nimpose a sanction. Beginning with the least severe, the sanctions\nare:\ni.\nundertakings\nii.\nconditions\niii.\nsuspension from the\ncourse;\niv.\nexpulsion from the\ncourse.\n(Guidance on the imposition of these sanctions is offered in the GMC document\nMedical trainees: professional behaviour and fitness to practise\n(2007) and the RPSGB (Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain) document\nGuidance on trainee fitness to practise procedures in schools of pharmacy\n(2009)).\n7.1\nWhere a trainee’s studies are terminated, assistance\nwill\nbe given to the trainee to transfer to an alternative course of study which does not provide a license to practise, if this is considered\nappropriate.\n7.2\nWhere it proves impossible to continue to offer the course because the trainee is deemed incapable on non-academic grounds (such as health) of completing it and will not therefore be fit to practise, every effort will be made to offer an appropriate alternative course of\nstudy.\n8.  Appeals\n8.1\nThe trainee may appeal to the University’s Academic Appeals Committee\nagainst any warning or sanction imposed by the Fitness to Practise\nCommittee.\n8.2\nThe policy and procedure for an appeal are set out in the Quality\nManual.\n9.  Confidentiality\nThe personal data of trainees will be processed by the University in compliance with the Data Protection Act. However, it may be necessary to pass personal information to other organisations such as the NHS,\nprofessional accrediting bodies or other institutes of higher education where there is a real issue about a trainee's fitness to practise and where this represents a risk to patients or members of the\npublic.\nAnnex D - Trainee complaints procedure\nThe investigation and determination of complaints shall follow the Complaints Procedures of the University directly responsible for the matters or persons or events complained of, and which has the authority to provide remedies where the complaints are upheld.\nWhere a complaint contains substantive elements relating to both universities, investigation and determination shall follow the Complaints Procedures of the trainee’s degree-awarding university, and the other university shall provide full co-operation.\nThese regulations can be accessed via:\nUniversity of Lincoln - Student Complaints\nUniversity of Nottingham - Student Complaints\nAnnex E - Academic offences\nThe Academic Offences Policy of the trainee’s degree awarding University shall apply to this programme.

Where academic policies and immigration policies seem to be contradictory, immigration policies will take precedence. For more information, please consult the following:\nImmigration sponsorship\n1.0 Purpose\nDuring periods when students are expected to be engaging with their programme, the prime focus of students must be on their studies.\n2.0 Key Principles\nWhilst the University realises that students may find it necessary to work in order to support themselves, they must not arrange any employment or other activity that will cause them to be unable to attend and engage with required activities or undertake required private study.\nAny students who are considering part-time employment are advised to discuss their position with their tutor before committing to that course of action.\nApprentices who are part time students on a programme designed to integrate with, and be supported by their contractual employment are expected to maintain supportive employment for the duration of their studies.\nNotwithstanding this, the University recognises the value of practical experience as part of the overall University experience and understands that students may wish to take up opportunities that will enhance their future employability. When considering any employment opportunities students must bear in mind the possible impact on their studies and only accept employment that is manageable alongside their student workload.\nIt must be noted that examinations may take place on Saturdays during the published examination periods and that reassessment examinations (for those required to take them) are normally held during August.\nThe University has a range of financial support packages that students may be eligible to access. For more information, see the link within 3.0 Related Regulations, Policies and Prcedures.\nExtenuating circumstances\nThe requirements of employment or other activities are not considered to be an acceptable extenuating circumstance. For more information about extenuating circumstances, please consult Extenuating circumstances pages directly, linked below.\n2.1 International students on the Points Based System: Student route\nInternational students on Points Based System: Student route are not normally allowed to work for more than 20 hours per week during term-times or required periods of engagement and, if they were to do so, they would be in breach of the immigration regulations and potentially subject to cancellation of their visa.\nAdvice for international students is available from the Visa and Immigration team within Student Services. For more information, please consult the following:\nVISA and Immigration Support\n2.2 Differences at University of Nottingham Ningbo China\nIncludes:\ncontact details\nDifferences may be present in the guidance and/or regulations concerning student employment during studies between the UK campus (UNUK) and University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC).\nFor more information about the guidance and/or regulations concerning student employment during studies at UNNC, please email:\ninternational@nottingham.edu.cn\n3.0 Related Regulations, Policies and Procedures\nStudent services - Financial support\nVisa and Immigration Support\nSupport packages\nExtenuating circumstances\n4.0 Version Control Table\nVersion Control Table\nVersion Number\nPurpose/Change\nApproving Committee\nDate\n1.0\nReformatted to align with the new University of Nottingham Policy Management Framework, based on content last modified on 5th December 2022\nQSC\nJuly 2024\nIf you have any problems or queries relating to this page, please contact:\nUNUK students\nStudent Services\nUNNC students\nAcademic-Service-Office@nottingham.edu.cn\nUNM students\nstudent_registry@nottingham.edu.my\nStaff\nQuality-Manual-Enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk\nThis content was last modified on\n31 July 2024||"

These regulations can be accessed via:\nUniversity of Lincoln - Extenuating Circumstances\nExtensions and Extenuating Circumstances Policy\nAs Health Service professional and full-time NHS employees, trainees have an obligation to be aware of any impairment to their fitness to work. This extends to academic work and the completion of assessments and assignments. If the submission of any assignment is likely to be adversely affected through illness or other significant personal circumstances outside their control, trainees must ask for an extension in advance of the submission date using the Extension Request Form.\nExtensions of up to two weeks can be agreed by the module convenor/module coordinator.\nExtensions of more than two weeks require the approval of the Co-director (Practice Learning) for Clinical Practice Reports or of the Co-director (Academic and Research) for all other assignments.\nTrainees who require a prolonged extension would normally be required to interrupt their studies.\nWhere trainees are aware of a disability or long-term medical condition, or other circumstances that are expected to have an impact on their performance in assessment, they should make their Personal Tutor aware of their disability or long-term medical condition at the earliest possible opportunity so that appropriate arrangements can be put in place.\nWhere trainees are aware of circumstances beyond their control that might adversely affect the submission of their Research Project Portfolio, they should inform their academic supervisor at the earliest opportunity, so that alternative hand-in dates can be agreed.\nClaims for extenuating circumstances after the submission date for an assignment has passed would normally raise a concern about the trainee’s fitness to practise, as they should have been aware of their impaired performance and requested an extension. In such a case, the module convenor / module co-ordinator would normally complete a Concern Form (see Fitness to Practise Procedure). Trainees who wish claim extenuating circumstances should complete and sign the relevant form and submit it to the Extenuating Circumstances Board of the University of Lincoln.\nThe Extenuating Circumstances Board will consider the claim and supporting documentation at their next regular meeting and determine whether extenuating circumstances obtain and whether the trainee’s reasons for not having sought an extension are valid. The Extenuating Circumstances Board will communicate its decision to the Chair of the Trent DClinPsy Board of Examiners. The decision whether to allow a resubmission of an assignment because of extenuating circumstances rests with the Board of Examiners.\nAnnex C - Fitness to practise\nThe Fitness to Practise regulations of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at the University of Nottingham shall apply to this programme, subject to the following adjustments:\nThe term ‘trainee’ shall be used throughout in preference to that of ‘student’.\nConcerns that a trainee may not be fit to practise Clinical Psychology shall be made to the Programme Co-Director at the trainee’s degree-awarding university. References to ‘the head of studies’ shall be read as referring to the relevant Programme Co-Director.\nIn the section headed ‘Investigations’, the reference to “the University’s Occupational Health Service” shall be read as referring to the trainee’s employer’s Occupational Health Service.\nThese regulations can be accessed via:\nUniversity of Lincoln - Fitness to Practise\nRegistration, attendance and study\nThe current form of the regulations, as they apply to the programme are as follows:\n1.     Initiation of the Procedure\n1.1.\nAny concerns that a trainee may have acted in such a way or may suffer from a health problem which may render that trainee a person not fit to be admitted to and practise Clinical Psychology should be disclosed to the Programme Co- Director at the trainee’s degree awarding university.\n1.2.\nThe disclosure should normally be made in writing using the concern form. In cases where the initial disclosure is not in the concern form format e.g. notification of criminal conviction, then the relevant Co-director should ensure that a concern form containing the disclosure is completed. The person making the disclosure must identify themselves; disclosures which are raised anonymously will not normally be considered. In exceptional circumstances the discloser’s identity may be permitted to remain confidential.\n1.3.\nThe raising of a concern form does not usually indicate a fitness to practise issue. However, the existence of multiple concern forms may show a pattern which does indicate a fitness to practise issue. Therefore on the receipt of an individual concern form which on its own does not raise a fitness to practise issue the Co- directors, should jointly review whether other concern forms have been raised, which when all considered together raise issues regarding the trainee’s fitness to practise, e.g. professional behaviour.\n1.4.\nWhere there are concerns that are serious then a trainee may be excluded from clinical placements by their Clinical Tutor on advice of the Co-directors. Some examples of a serious concern would include, but not as an exclusive list, situations where\npatients may be placed at risk or\nthe profession might be brought into disrepute by the public knowing that the trainee remained in a clinical environment or;\nthat a trainee’s conduct was deemed to be disruptive to the delivery of clinical care or clinical teaching  in a partner, usually NHS, organisation.\nConcerns may be such that trainees can be suspended from their course with immediate effect by the Dean or by the head of studies. If this decision is based on a concern related to discipline or health and safety then appropriate procedures as set out within the Code of Discipline for Students and the Quality Manual should be followed.\nIf trainees are allowed to return from suspension, they will be expected to comply with any conditions decided by the School or imposed as part of the outcome of any other procedure.\n1.5.\nA trainee will not be allowed to graduate from either University if they are subject to a fitness to practise investigation or hearing which has not been completed.\n2.  Investigations\n2.1.\nOn receipt of a disclosure which gives rise to a fitness to practise concern, the relevant Co-director shall promptly, and normally within 5 working days, arrange for the matter to be investigated and shall notify the trainee of the following:\nThe basis of the concerns and any allegations against him/her.\nThe identity of the investigating officer.\nAny limitations or conditions placed upon the continuance of studies or supervised practice during the period of the investigation.\n2.2.\nThe trainee can register an objection to the appointment of the investigating officer on the basis of a lack of impartiality. Such an objection needs to the relevant Co-director within 5 working days. Examples would include where the investigating officer has initially raised the concern e.g. probity issues, or where the investigating officer has had interaction with the trainee on an unrelated contentious issue. If this objection is upheld a new investigating officer should be appointed.\n2.3.\nThe investigating officer may request members of staff connected with the case to provide written comments on the trainee’s conduct and/or health, explaining why there is concern as to fitness to practise. Factual information about the trainee’s professional progress on the course and any other relevant documentation should also be provided.\n2.4.\nThe investigating officer shall interview relevant individuals including the trainee himself/herself. At such interviews the investigating officer shall be accompanied by an assistant who shall prepare a written note of the interview.\n2.5.\nThe investigating officer should ensure that the trainee is advised of appropriate pastoral support mechanisms within their University and Trainees’ Union.\n2.6.\nThe trainee is entitled to have a person of their choosing attend the interview with them in order to support them at the meeting. The trainee should confirm the name and status of the person accompanying them in writing to the Investigating Officer in advance of the interview. The person supporting the trainee is not attending the interview as an advocate or character witness.\n2.7.\nThe trainee may be required to attend their employer’s Occupational Health Service in order that advice on his or her fitness to practise on medical grounds may be sought. In cases where there is evidence of recurring health problems or with addictive behaviours, Occupational health referral is required.\n2.8.\nSave in exceptional circumstances, the investigating officer shall, no later than 15 working days after the referral by the Co-directors, make a written report of the results of the investigation to the Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at The University of Nottingham detailing all evidence obtained. From this point onwards all further stages of the Fitness to Practise Procedure are handled by the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at The University of Nottingham.\n3   Referral to Fitness to Practise Committee\n3.1\nPromptly on receipt of the report from the investigating officer, and in any event within 5 working days, the Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences shall consult the Dean of the Faculty who will determine, in the light of the seriousness of the matter and the strength of the evidence, whether the case should be referred to the Fitness to Practise Committee.\n3.2\nThe Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences will notify the trainee in writing of the following.\nThe outcome of the investigation and the Dean’s decision.\nWhether the matter is to be referred to the Fitness to Practise Committee together with full details of the procedures to be adopted.\nThe imposition of any conditions/limitations placed on the trainee’s studies.\n3.3\nIn the event that the Fitness to Practise Committee is to be convened, the Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences will notify the trainee of the identity of the Committee members and the date of the proposed meeting of the Committee and make available to him/her, all of the evidence detailed in the investigating officer’s report.\n3.4\nThe trainee shall be allowed at least 15 working days in which to prepare his/her case. All information on which the trainee intends to rely must be received by the FTP Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, who will then distribute this information to the members of the Fitness to Practise Committee and the Investigating Officer, at least 5 working days before the date set for the meeting of the Committee.\n3.5\nIn exceptional circumstances the Dean may determine that a warning should be issued to the trainee without a Fitness to Practise Committee hearing as the means of disposal of the FTP procedure, according to section 7 (below). The usual example of when this would be considered is when a criminal conviction or caution has been admitted. This disposal shall only be considered when the following four conditions are met\nWith the agreement of the trainee, confirmed in writing to the FTP Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences\nWhen the trainee fully admits to the allegation upon which a concern has been based. This admission would be part of the evidence provided by the investigating officer.\nThe trainee demonstrates insight into the nature of the concern and expresses remorse as specified in the evidence provided by the investigating officer\nWhen the Dean is satisfied that the nature of the concern does not raise the possibility of another outcome beyond a warning as specified in section 7 (below)\n4   Attendance at the Meeting\n4.1\nThe trainee will be required to attend the meeting in person.  If the trainee fails to attend without reasonable explanation, the Committee will consider the case in the trainee’s absence. The Chair will have discretion as to what constitutes a ‘reasonable explanation’.\n4.2\nThe University’s case will be presented by the investigating officer or his or her nominee.\n4.3\nAt the discretion of the Chair, the Committee may also call upon other persons (whether or not a current member of the University) to provide advice on specific aspects of the case in writing or in person.\n4.4\nThe trainee is entitled to have a person of their choosing attend the hearing with them (referred to here as \"the friend\"), and is permitted to have the person of their choosing speak on their behalf. The trainee should confirm the name and status of the person accompanying them in writing to the Secretary no less than four working days before the hearing.\n5  Composition of the Committee\n5.1\nThe Committee will comprise as a minimum the Chair (a senior member of the academic staff from outside the professional discipline of the trainee) and two members. At least one member should be a clinically active member of the same professional discipline as the trainee. The Committee will be serviced by a Secretary who is not a member but will be present throughout the proceedings.\n5.2\nAnyone who is asked to be a member of the Committee, who has been personally involved in the trainee's case at any prior stage needs to inform the Secretary to the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of this. This person will then not be able to be a member of the Committee and another member will need to be appointed.\n6  Procedure for the conduct of the meeting\nThis section is a guide to the conduct of the meeting itself. The Chair has discretion to vary these arrangements as she/he thinks fit.\n6.1\nPrior to the meeting the Secretary to the Committee will ensure the trainee has copies of all documents circulated to members of the Committee and is aware of the procedures to be followed.\n6.2\nThe Chair will ask if any member has been personally involved in the trainee's case at any prior stage and, if so, will ask them to withdraw from the meeting.\n6.3\nThe trainee, the friend (if attending) and staff will then join the Committee.\n6.4\nThe Chair will introduce by name and explain the functions of the members of the Committee, the staff, and any others present.\n6.5\nThe Chair will explain the powers of the Committee, as set out in section7.\n6.6\nThe Chair will invite the investigating officer (or nominee) to make an opening statement and then invite the Committee to ask questions. Other staff attending will be offered the same opportunity to make a statement and may be asked questions.\n6.7\nThe Chair will invite the trainee or the friend to make a statement. The Chair will explain that the Committee will wish to hear directly from the trainee in their own words.\n6.8\nMembers of the Committee will be invited to question the trainee.\n6.9\nThe Chair will invite any other person(s) called upon by the Chair to attend the meeting (as referred to in section 4.3), to make a brief statement, and will then invite the Committee to ask questions.\n6.10\nAt each stage the Chair has discretion to allow reciprocal questioning by the various parties.\n6.11\nOnce the Chair is satisfied that the Committee has completed their questioning and the trainee and staff have had a full opportunity to convey information to the Committee, both the trainee and members of staff will withdraw.\n6.12\nThe Committee will then discuss the case.\n6.13\nIf for any reason the Committee requires further clarification of any aspect of the case from either the trainee or staff members they must be all invited back into the meeting while the questioning takes place. When the Chair so determines they will then leave the meeting again.\n6.14\nThe Committee will make its decision on the basis of the balance of probabilities and shall be taken by a simple majority of the members present and voting. The Chair shall have a casting vote in the event of a tie.\n6.15\nThe decision, and any findings of fact, will be conveyed to the trainee and the other parties as soon as possible, and will in any event be conveyed to the trainee in writing within two working days of the decision being reached.\n7  Powers of the Fitness to Practise Committee\n7.1\nThe Committee, following consideration of the case, has the power to:\npermit the trainee to continue with the course with no warning or sanction;\nwarn the trainee that there is evidence of misconduct but the trainee’s fitness to practise is not impaired to a point requiring any of the sanctions listed below;\nimpose a sanction. Beginning with the least severe, the sanctions are:\n- undertakings\n- conditions\n- suspension from the course\n- exclusion from the course\n(Guidance on the imposition of these sanctions is offered in the GMC document\nMedical trainees: professional behaviour and fitness to practise\n(2007) and the RPSGB (Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain) document\nGuidance on trainee fitness to practise procedures in schools of pharmacy\n(2009)).\n7.2\nWhere a trainee’s studies are terminated, assistance will be given to the trainee to transfer to an alternative course of study which does not provide a license to practise, if this is considered appropriate.\n7.3\nWhere it proves impossible to continue to offer the course because the trainee is deemed incapable on non-academic grounds (such as health) of completing it and will not therefore be fit to practise, every effort will be made to offer an appropriate alternative course of study.\n8  Appeals\n8.1\nThe trainee may appeal to the University’s Academic Appeals Committee against any warning or sanction imposed by the Fitness to Practise Committee.\n8.2\nThe policy and procedure for an appeal are set out in the Quality Manual.\n9  Confidentiality\nThe personal data of trainees will be processed by the University in compliance with the Data Protection Act. However, it may be necessary to pass personal information to other organisations such as the NHS, professional accrediting bodies or other institutes of higher education where there is a real issue about a trainee's fitness to practise and where this represents a risk to patients or members of the public.\nAnnex D - Trainee complaints procedure\nThe investigation and determination of complaints shall follow the Complaints Procedures of the University directly responsible for the matters or persons or events complained of, and which has the authority to provide remedies where the complaints are upheld.\nWhere a complaint contains substantive elements relating to both universities, investigation and determination shall follow the Complaints Procedures of the trainee’s degree-awarding university, and the other university shall provide full co-operation.\nThese regulations can be accessed via:\nUniversity of Lincoln - Student Complaints\nConcerns, complaints and appeals\nAnnex E - Academic offences\nThe Academic Offences Policy of the trainee’s degree-awarding university shall apply to this programme. These regulations can be accessed via:\nUniversity of Lincoln - Academic Offences\nPolicy on academic misconduct\nAnnex F - Academic appeals\nThe Academic Appeals Policy of the trainee’s degree-awarding university shall apply to this programme.
