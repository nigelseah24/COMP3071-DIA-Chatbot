The regulations are applied when authorized by the Senate and aim to deliver learning outcomes while maintaining flexibility in evaluating student performance."
Contingency classification and progression regulations,What options do students have if they receive a Part For Whole Mark or a Derived Mark due to disrupted assessments?,"Students who receive a Part For Whole Mark or a Derived Mark have the choice to either accept the progression or classification decision with the associated marks or reject them. If they accept, unmarked assessments will not be marked later, and no Equivalent Sit opportunities will be offered. If they reject, they will have to wait for Actual Marks to be obtained through marking of original assessments or be offered an Equivalent Sit if the original assessment won't be marked. This decision must be made within a designated decision period, and non-response is considered acceptance by default."
Contingency classification and progression regulations,How are Extenuating Circumstances handled under the contingency regulations for students who have pending assessments?,"For students with upheld Extenuating Circumstances affecting pending assessments, the University records a zero for those assessments until they are submitted. If the zero impacts the calculation of Derived Marks, this could lower the mark, influencing progression or classification decisions. The zero mark can be excluded from calculations if the non-Extenuating Circumstances assessments meet certain criteria, like being worth at least 40% of the module. Students must consider these implications carefully when deciding whether to accept the contingency regulations or wait for Actual Marks."

For example, you must either pass modules worth 80 credits and have a stage average of at least 40% with no module marks below 30%, or meet other specified credit and average mark requirements. However, this does not apply to the final stage or non-compensatable modules, which require reassessment."
Regulations from September 2019 to September 2020,"How do extenuating circumstances affect my degree classification, and can they impact my final mark?","Extenuating circumstances can impact your degree classification if they meet specific criteria, such as affecting modules worth no more than 20 credits in your final year where reassessment wasn't possible. Marks from these modules may be excluded from your final average calculation, provided all non-compensatable modules are passed and the Extenuating Circumstances panel deems this exclusion more representative of your usual performance."
Undergraduate degree classification from September 2015 to September 2020,How are undergraduate degree classifications determined for students who began their studies between September 2015 and September 2020 at the University of Nottingham?,"Undergraduate degree classifications for students who entered their Qualifying year or Part I between September 2015 and before September 2020 are determined using a weighted numerical average. Module marks are calculated and weighted based on the number of credits, and a weighted numerical average is rounded to determine the degree classification. The classifications are: First Class (70%+), Upper Second Class (60%-69%), Lower Second Class (50%-59%), Third Class (40%-49%), and Pass (40%+)."
Undergraduate degree classification from September 2015 to September 2020,What should a student do if they have extenuating circumstances that might affect their degree classification?,"If a student has extenuating circumstances, they should be considered in accordance with the University's Extenuating Circumstances Policy and Procedures. It's important for students to communicate their circumstances to the university so that these can be taken into account when determining their final degree classification."
Undergraduate degree classification from September 2015 to September 2020,Can you explain what the borderline marks mean and how they affect degree classifications?,"Borderline marks are specific rounded marks that are close to the threshold of a higher degree classification. For instance, marks of 68/69 fall within the Borderline First Class, 58/59 for Borderline Upper Second Class, and 48/49 for Borderline Lower Second Class.
